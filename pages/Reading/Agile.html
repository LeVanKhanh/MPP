            12 Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
        </a>
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of <b>valuable software</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Welcome changing requirements</b>, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
        <li><b>Deliver working software frequently</b>, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
        <li>Business people and developers must <b>work together daily</b> throughout the project.</li>
        <li>Build projects around <b>motivated individuals</b>. Give them the environment and <b>support they need</b>, and <b>trust them</b> to get the job done.</li>
        <li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is <b>face-to-face conversation</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Working software</b> is the primary measure of progress.</li>
        <li>Agile processes promote <b>sustainable development</b>. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
        <li>Continuous attention to <b>technical excellence</b> and good design enhances agility.</li>
        <li>Simplicity—the art of <b>maximizing the amount of work not done</b>—is essential.</li>
        <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from <b>self-organizing teams</b>.</li>
        <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to <b>become more effective</b>, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>
