# Training Principles

## Progressive Overload: Gradually increase resistance (weight, reps, sets, frequency) over time to force adaptation and growth.
## Specificity: Train muscles in ways that mimic desired movements (e.g., heavy lifting for strength, higher reps for pump).
## Mechanical Tension: Lift heavy (80-90% 1RM) for fewer reps (3-5) to create tension
## Metabolic Stress: Achieve "the pump" with higher reps (10-15+) and shorter rest periods.
## Muscle Damage: Incorporate slow negatives, full range of motion, and exercise variation to create micro-tears.
## Proper Technique & Form: Essential for targeting the right muscles and preventing injury.
## Consistency: Regular workouts are key; don't skip sessions or meals. 

# Nutritional Principles

## Protein: Provides amino acids, the building blocks for muscle repair and growth (fish, chicken, dairy, beans)
## Calories: Eat in a slight surplus (250-500 calories above maintenance) for growth, focusing on whole foods.
## Macronutrients: Balance protein, carbs (for fuel), and fats (for hormones). 

# Recovery Principles

## Rest Days: Muscles grow when resting, not during workouts.
## Sleep: Crucial for hormone regulation and muscle repair.
## Adequate Recovery: Allow enough time between training the same muscle group (e.g., 48 hours). 

# Key Takeaways
- Training provides the stimulus, nutrition provides the building blocks, and rest allows the growth.
- Focus on compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, presses) for overall mass, using isolation moves for refinement.
- Listen to your body and adjust intensity/volume to avoid overtraining and injury.
