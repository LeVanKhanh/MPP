            <ol class="numbered-outline">
                <li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of <strong>valuable software</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Welcome changing requirements</strong>, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
                <li><strong>Deliver working software frequently</strong>, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
                <li>Business people and developers must <strong>work together daily</strong> throughout the project.</li>
                <li>Build projects around <strong>motivated individuals</strong>. Give them the environment and <strong>support they need</strong>, and <strong>trust them</strong> to get the job done.</li>
                <li>The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is <strong>face-to-face conversation</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Working software</strong> is the primary measure of progress.</li>
                <li>Agile processes promote <strong>sustainable development</strong>. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
                <li>Continuous attention to <strong>technical excellence</strong> and good design enhances agility.</li>
                <li>Simplicity—the art of <strong>maximizing the amount of work not done</strong>—is essential.</li>
                <li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from <strong>self-organizing teams</strong>.</li>
                <li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to <strong>become more effective</strong>, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>
