            <p>Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.</p>
            <p>In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:</p>
            <ol class="numbered-outline">
                <li>A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.</li>
                <li>The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.</li>
                <li>The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.</li>
                <li>Repeat</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Other Scrum Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Goal: </strong> 
                The Product Goal is an objective for the Scrum Team to achieve in the future. It provides a long-term direction for the Scrum Team and is a commitment in the Product Backlog.
            </li>
            <li><strong>User Story:</strong>
                A User Story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. It typically follows the format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]."
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ordering the Product Backlog:</strong>
                The Product Owner is responsible for ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions. This involves considering factors such as value, risk, priority, and dependencies.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sizing the Product Backlog Items:</strong>
                Sizing Product Backlog items is the process of estimating the effort required to complete each item. This helps the Scrum Team plan and prioritize work effectively.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Story Point:</strong>
                A Story Point is a unit of measure for expressing the overall effort required to fully implement a Product Backlog item or any other piece of work. Story Points are typically based on complexity, risk, and effort rather than time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Planning Poker:</strong>
                Planning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating the effort or relative size of development goals in software development. It involves the Scrum Team using numbered cards to vote on estimates.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Product Backlog Refinement:</strong>
                Product Backlog Refinement is the ongoing process of reviewing and updating the Product Backlog items to ensure they are well understood, appropriately detailed, and prioritized.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Definition of "Ready":</strong>
                The Definition of "Ready" is a set of criteria that a Product Backlog item must meet before the Scrum Team can consider it for inclusion in a Sprint. This ensures that items are sufficiently understood and actionable.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Definition of "Done":</strong> 
                The Definition of "Done" is a shared understanding within the Scrum Team of what it means for work to be complete. It ensures transparency and quality by setting clear criteria that must be met before a Product Backlog item is considered done.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Burn-down Chart:</strong>
                A Burn-down Chart is a visual representation of the work remaining versus time in a Sprint. It helps the Scrum Team track progress toward completing the Sprint Goal.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Burn-up Chart:</strong>
                A Burn-up Chart is a visual representation of the work completed versus total work in a project. It helps track progress and scope changes over time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cumulative Flow Diagram:</strong> 
                A Cumulative Flow Diagram is a visual tool that shows the status of work items in a process over time. It helps identify bottlenecks and monitor workflow efficiency.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Technical Debt:</strong> 
                Technical Debt refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. It can accumulate and impact the quality and maintainability of the product.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Goal:</strong>
                 During Sprint Planning, the whole Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Canceling a Sprint:</strong> 
                A Sprint can be canceled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.
            </li>
