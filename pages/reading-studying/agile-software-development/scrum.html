    <section>
        <h2>Scrum Definition</h2>
        <p>Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.</p>
        <p>In a nutshell, Scrum requires a Scrum Master to foster an environment where:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.</li>
            <li>The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment of value during a Sprint.</li>
            <li>The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.</li>
            <li>Repeat</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Scrum Theory</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking.</li>
            <li>Scrum pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Scrum Events</h2>

        <h3>The Sprint</h3>
        <p>During the Sprint:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;</li>
            <li>Quality does not decrease;</li>
            <li>The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,</li>
            <li>Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.</p>

        <h3>Sprint Planning</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Topic One:</strong> Why is this Sprint valuable?</li>
            <li><strong>Topic Two:</strong> What can be Done this Sprint?</li>
            <li><strong>Topic Three:</strong> How will the chosen work get done?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Daily Scrum</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal;</li>
            <li>Adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work;</li>
            <li>Optimize team collaboration and performance;</li>
            <li>Focus on creating a plan for the next 24 hours;</li>
            <li>Keep the event within the 15-minute time-box.</li>
            <li>The Developers are accountable for conducting the Daily Scrum.</li>
            <li>The Scrum Master ensures that the Developers have the meeting, but the Developers are the ones who actually conduct the Daily Scrum.</li>
            <li>The Daily Scrum is recommended (not required) to be held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.</li>
            <li>The Daily Scrum improves communications, identifies impediments, promotes quick decision-making, and consequently eliminates the need for other meetings.</li>
            <li>During the Daily Scrum, the Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work.</li>   
            <li>Common ways (not always) to conduct the Daily Scrum include: the three questions (What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Do I see any impediment?), walk the board, or discuss the Sprint Goal.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sprint Review</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>The Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint and is time-boxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.</li>
            <li>The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendees understand its purpose;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sprint Retrospective</h3>

        <h2>Other Scrum Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Product Goal: </strong> 
                The Product Goal is an objective for the Scrum Team to achieve in the future. It provides a long-term direction for the Scrum Team and is a commitment in the Product Backlog.
            </li>
            <li><strong>User Story:</strong>
                A User Story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. It typically follows the format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]."
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ordering the Product Backlog:</strong>
                The Product Owner is responsible for ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions. This involves considering factors such as value, risk, priority, and dependencies.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sizing the Product Backlog Items:</strong>
                Sizing Product Backlog items is the process of estimating the effort required to complete each item. This helps the Scrum Team plan and prioritize work effectively.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Story Point:</strong>
                A Story Point is a unit of measure for expressing the overall effort required to fully implement a Product Backlog item or any other piece of work. Story Points are typically based on complexity, risk, and effort rather than time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Planning Poker:</strong>
                Planning Poker is a consensus-based technique for estimating the effort or relative size of development goals in software development. It involves the Scrum Team using numbered cards to vote on estimates.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Product Backlog Refinement:</strong>
                Product Backlog Refinement is the ongoing process of reviewing and updating the Product Backlog items to ensure they are well understood, appropriately detailed, and prioritized.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Definition of "Ready":</strong>
                The Definition of "Ready" is a set of criteria that a Product Backlog item must meet before the Scrum Team can consider it for inclusion in a Sprint. This ensures that items are sufficiently understood and actionable.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The Definition of "Done":</strong> 
                The Definition of "Done" is a shared understanding within the Scrum Team of what it means for work to be complete. It ensures transparency and quality by setting clear criteria that must be met before a Product Backlog item is considered done.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Burn-down Chart:</strong>
                A Burn-down Chart is a visual representation of the work remaining versus time in a Sprint. It helps the Scrum Team track progress toward completing the Sprint Goal.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Burn-up Chart:</strong>
                A Burn-up Chart is a visual representation of the work completed versus total work in a project. It helps track progress and scope changes over time.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Cumulative Flow Diagram:</strong> 
                A Cumulative Flow Diagram is a visual tool that shows the status of work items in a process over time. It helps identify bottlenecks and monitor workflow efficiency.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Technical Debt:</strong> 
                Technical Debt refers to the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer. It can accumulate and impact the quality and maintainability of the product.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sprint Goal:</strong>
                 During Sprint Planning, the whole Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Canceling a Sprint:</strong> 
                A Sprint can be canceled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.
            </li>
        </ul>
