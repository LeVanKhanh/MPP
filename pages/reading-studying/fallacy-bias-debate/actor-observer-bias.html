            <p class="intro-text">Actor-observer bias is the tendency to attribute our own actions to external, situational factors while attributing other people's actions to their internal characteristics or personality. When we make mistakes, we tend to blame circumstances; when others make the same mistakes, we blame their character or competence. This asymmetry in attribution affects our judgments of ourselves and others in profound ways.</p>

        <!-- Examples -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Actor-observer bias appears frequently in how we judge behavior on the road and in daily interactions.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Driving Behavior</h3>
                <p>When we cut someone off in traffic, we attribute it to situational factors: "I'm running late," "I didn't see them," or "The road design is confusing." However, when another driver cuts us off, we're quick to attribute it to their character: "They're a reckless driver," "They're inconsiderate," or "They don't know how to drive." The same behavior is interpreted differently depending on whether we're the actor or the observer.</p>

        <!-- Mitigation Strategies -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Reducing actor-observer bias requires conscious effort to consider alternative explanations for behavior.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Perspective-Taking</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Imagine their situation:</strong> Before judging someone's behavior, pause and consider what situational factors might be influencing their actions</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask yourself "what if?":</strong> When someone behaves in a way you find problematic, ask "What if I were in their exact situation—how might I behave?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Reverse the scenario:</strong> Consider how you would explain your own behavior if you acted the same way, then apply that same charitable interpretation to others</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek information:</strong> Before jumping to conclusions about someone's character, try to learn more about the context and circumstances surrounding their behavior</li>
                    <li><strong>Apply equal standards:</strong> Hold yourself to the same standards you apply to others, and vice versa—if you would excuse your own behavior due to circumstances, extend the same consideration to others</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice empathy:</strong> Regularly engage in exercises that help you see situations from other people's perspectives</li>
                    <li><strong>Question your first impression:</strong> When you find yourself making a character judgment about someone, pause and consider alternative explanations for their behavior</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Actor-observer bias causes us to judge our own actions by our intentions and circumstances while judging others' actions by their character. By practicing perspective-taking and applying equal standards to ourselves and others, we can develop more fair and accurate assessments of behavior and build better relationships.</p>
