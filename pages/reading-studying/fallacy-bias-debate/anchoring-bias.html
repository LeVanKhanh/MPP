			<h2 class="main-point">Definition</h2>
			<p class="intro-text">Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias where individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information (the "anchor") they receive when making decisions, which can unduly influence subsequent judgments and estimates.</p>

			<h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Price Negotiations:</strong> The initial price offered can set the tone for the entire negotiation, influencing subsequent offers and counteroffers</li>
				<li><strong>Salary Discussions:</strong> The first salary figure mentioned can anchor expectations for the entire negotiation</li>
				<li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> The listing price of a property can influence buyers' perceptions of its value</li>
				<li><strong>Legal Sentencing:</strong> Initial sentencing recommendations can anchor judges' final decisions</li>
			</ul>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Causes</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Cognitive Heuristics:</strong> The brain's tendency to use mental shortcuts for efficiency</li>
				<li><strong>Insufficient Adjustment:</strong> Failure to adequately adjust away from the anchor when making estimates</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Consequences</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>Skewed Judgments: Decisions may be biased towards the anchor, leading to suboptimal outcomes</li>
				<li>Reduced Objectivity: Overreliance on initial information can hinder critical evaluation of alternatives</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>Awareness and Education: Inform individuals about anchoring bias to promote self-awareness</li>
				<li>Consider Multiple Anchors: Evaluate information from various sources to avoid overreliance on a single anchor</li>
				<li>Deliberate Adjustment: Make conscious efforts to adjust estimates away from the anchor</li>
				<li>Seek Objective Data: Base decisions on factual information rather than initial impressions</li>
			</ul>

				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Key Takeaway</h3>
				<p>Anchoring bias shows how the first piece of information we receive can have a disproportionate influence on our decisions. By being aware of this effect and deliberately considering alternative reference points, we can make more balanced judgments.</p>
