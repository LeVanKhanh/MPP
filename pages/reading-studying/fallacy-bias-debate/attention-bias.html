            <p class="intro-text">Attention bias is the tendency to pay attention to some things while simultaneously ignoring others. This cognitive bias affects how we perceive our environment by causing us to selectively focus on certain stimuli—often those that are emotionally salient, threatening, or aligned with our current concerns—while filtering out other potentially important information. Our attention becomes disproportionately drawn to specific types of information, skewing our perception of reality.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Attention bias manifests in both clinical and everyday contexts.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Anxiety Disorders</h3>
                <p>People with anxiety disorders often exhibit attention bias toward threatening or negative stimuli. For example, someone with social anxiety may focus disproportionately on facial expressions that could be interpreted as disapproving or critical, while missing neutral or positive social cues. This selective attention reinforces their anxiety and maintains the disorder in a self-perpetuating cycle.</p>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Advertising</h3>
                <p>Marketers exploit attention bias by using bright colors, movement, attractive people, or emotionally charged imagery to capture and hold our attention. Once a brand successfully captures our attention, we're more likely to notice their products in stores and remember them when making purchase decisions. This is why companies invest heavily in creating memorable, attention-grabbing advertisements.</p>

        <!-- Mitigation Strategies -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Managing attention bias requires developing awareness of our attentional patterns and practicing techniques to broaden our focus.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Mindfulness Practices</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Meditation:</strong> Regular mindfulness meditation helps you observe your attentional patterns without judgment and develop greater control over where you direct your focus</li>
                    <li><strong>Body scan exercises:</strong> Practice systematically attending to different parts of your body to develop the ability to shift attention deliberately</li>
                    <li><strong>Present-moment awareness:</strong> Periodically pause during the day to notice what you're paying attention to and what you might be missing</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-judgmental observation:</strong> When you notice your attention drawn to certain stimuli, observe this tendency without self-criticism</li>
                    <li><strong>Attention training:</strong> Practice focusing on neutral or positive aspects of your environment rather than defaulting to threat-related or negative stimuli</li>
                    <li><strong>Cognitive behavioral approaches:</strong> Work with trained professionals to identify and modify maladaptive attention patterns, especially if they're contributing to anxiety or other mental health concerns</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="main-point">Summary</h2>
            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Attention bias causes us to selectively focus on certain information while ignoring other potentially important stimuli, often in ways that reinforce existing emotional states or beliefs. Through mindfulness practices and deliberate attention training, we can become more aware of our attentional patterns and develop greater flexibility in where we direct our focus.</p>
