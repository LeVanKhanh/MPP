			<h2 class="main-point">Definition</h2>
			<p class="intro-text">The availability heuristic is a cognitive bias where individuals estimate the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples or instances of that event come to mind, often leading to overestimation of rare but memorable occurrences.</p>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Fear of Flying:</strong> People may overestimate the dangers of air travel due to high-profile plane crashes covered extensively in the media</li>
				<li><strong>Crime Perception:</strong> Individuals may believe crime rates are higher than they are because of frequent news reports on violent crimes</li>
				<li><strong>Health Risks:</strong> People may overestimate the risk of rare diseases after hearing about them in the news or from acquaintances</li>
				<li><strong>Lottery Winning:</strong> Individuals may overestimate their chances of winning the lottery due to stories of big winners</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Causes</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Media Coverage:</strong> Sensational or dramatic events receive more attention, making them more memorable</li>
				<li><strong>Personal Experience:</strong> Events that individuals have personally experienced are more salient</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Consequences</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>Misjudged Risks: Overestimation or underestimation of event likelihood can lead to poor decision-making</li>
				<li>Skewed Perceptions: Individuals may develop distorted views of reality based on memorable events</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>Awareness and Education: Inform individuals about the availability heuristic to promote critical evaluation</li>
				<li>Seek Statistical Data: Rely on objective data rather than anecdotal evidence</li>
				<li>Consider Base Rates: Evaluate the actual frequency of events in the general population</li>
				<li>Diverse Information Sources: Gather information from multiple perspectives to counteract biased recall</li>
			</ul>

				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Key Takeaway</h3>
				<p>The availability heuristic reminds us that memorable events don't necessarily reflect statistical reality. By consulting objective data and base rates, we can make more accurate risk assessments rather than relying solely on what easily comes to mind.</p>
