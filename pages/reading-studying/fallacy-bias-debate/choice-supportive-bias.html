            <h2 class="main-point">Definition</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Choice-supportive bias is the tendency to retroactively ascribe positive attributes to an option we've chosen and negative attributes to options we rejected, regardless of the actual merits of each option. After making a decision, we tend to remember our chosen option as having been better than it actually was and the forgone alternatives as having been worse than they were. This bias helps us feel good about our decisions but can prevent us from learning from mistakes and making better choices in the future.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Consumer Purchases</h3>
                <p>After buying a product, especially an expensive one like a car or electronic device, people tend to focus on its positive features and downplay its negative aspects, even if they were initially ambivalent about the purchase. Meanwhile, they remember the rejected alternatives as having had more flaws than they actually did. This bias helps reduce buyer's remorse but can lead to repeated poor purchasing decisions if we don't accurately assess what worked and what didn't.</p>

            <p class="intro-text">Counteracting choice-supportive bias requires honest evaluation of both successes and failures.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Reflective Practices</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Pre-decision documentation:</strong> Before making important choices, write down the pros and cons of each option to create an objective record for later review</li>
                    <li><strong>Post-decision review:</strong> After sufficient time has passed, revisit your decision and compare the actual outcomes with your initial expectations</li>
                    <li><strong>Acknowledge regrets:</strong> Be honest with yourself when a choice doesn't work out well, rather than retroactively justifying it</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider counterfactuals:</strong> Thoughtfully consider how rejected alternatives might have turned out—could they have been better?</li>
                    <li><strong>Separate ego from decision:</strong> Recognize that making a poor choice doesn't make you a poor decision-maker; it's a learning opportunity</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek objective feedback:</strong> Ask others who weren't involved in the decision to evaluate the outcome objectively</li>
                    <li><strong>Track decision patterns:</strong> Keep a decision journal to identify recurring patterns in your choice-making and outcomes</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice self-compassion:</strong> Be kind to yourself about past mistakes while still learning from them, avoiding the need to retroactively justify every choice</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Choice-supportive bias causes us to remember our decisions as better than they actually were and rejected alternatives as worse than they were, protecting our ego but limiting our learning. By documenting our decision-making process, honestly evaluating outcomes, and separating our self-worth from our choices, we can develop better judgment and make improved decisions over time.</p>
