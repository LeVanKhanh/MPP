			<h2 class="main-point">Definition</h2>
			<p class="intro-text">The framing effect is a cognitive bias where people react differently to a particular choice or situation depending on how it is presented or "framed," such as in terms of potential gains versus potential losses.</p>

			<h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Medical Decisions:</strong> Patients may choose a treatment with a "90% survival rate" over one with a "10% mortality rate," despite both conveying the same information</li>
				<li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Consumers are more likely to buy a product labeled as "80% fat-free" rather than "20% fat"</li>
				<li><strong>Political Messaging:</strong> Voters may respond more favorably to policies described as "protecting jobs" rather than "preventing unemployment"</li>
				<li><strong>Legal Contexts:</strong> Jurors may be influenced by how evidence is presented, such as "evidence showing guilt" versus "lack of evidence showing innocence"</li>
			</ul>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Types of Framing</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Gain vs. Loss Framing:</strong> Presenting outcomes in terms of benefits (gains) or costs (losses)</li>
				<li><strong>Attribute Framing:</strong> Highlighting specific attributes of a choice, such as quality or price</li>
				<li><strong>Goal Framing:</strong> Emphasizing the positive or negative consequences of achieving or failing to achieve a goal</li>
				<li><strong>Risk Framing:</strong> Presenting options in terms of potential risks or safety</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Effects on Decision-Making</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Risk Aversion:</strong> People tend to avoid risks when options are framed as gains</li>
				<li><strong>Risk Seeking:</strong> People are more willing to take risks when options are framed as losses</li>
				<li><strong>Preference Reversals:</strong> Choices can change based on framing, even when the underlying facts remain constant</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>Awareness and Education: Educate individuals about the framing effect to promote critical evaluation of information</li>
				<li>Reframing: Present information in multiple ways to provide a balanced perspective</li>
				<li>Seek Objective Data: Focus on factual information rather than emotional appeals</li>
				<li>Encourage Critical Thinking: Promote analysis of the underlying facts regardless of presentation</li>
				<li>Diverse Perspectives: Involve multiple viewpoints to counteract individual biases</li>
			</ul>

				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Key Takeaway</h3>
				<p>The framing effect demonstrates that the way information is presented can significantly influence our decisions, even when the underlying facts are identical. Being aware of this bias helps us make more rational choices based on substance rather than presentation.</p>
