			<h2 class="main-point">Definition</h2>
			<p class="intro-text">Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon where the desire for harmony and conformity within a group leads to irrational or dysfunctional decision-making, as members suppress dissenting opinions to maintain unity, overriding realistic appraisal of alternatives and critical thinking.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Bay of Pigs Invasion (1961):</strong> U.S. government's failed attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba, where advisors ignored warnings and alternative strategies</li>
				<li><strong>Challenger Space Shuttle Disaster (1986):</strong> NASA officials dismissed engineers' concerns about O-ring failures due to pressure to proceed with the launch</li>
				<li><strong>Watergate Scandal (1972):</strong> Nixon administration's involvement in the break-in and subsequent cover-up</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Key Characteristics</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Illusion of invulnerability:</strong> The group feels overly optimistic and believes it can't fail</li>
				<li><strong>Self-censorship:</strong> Members withhold dissenting views to avoid conflict</li>
				<li><strong>Illusion of unanimity:</strong> Silence is interpreted as agreement, or a false sense of agreement is created</li>
				<li><strong>Mindguards:</strong> Some members protect the group from dissenting information or viewpoints</li>
				<li><strong>Stereotyping Outsiders:</strong> The group views opponents or outsiders negatively</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Causes</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>High group cohesion: Strong bonds among members can lead to prioritizing harmony over critical evaluation</li>
				<li>Insulation from outside opinions: Lack of external input can reinforce group biases</li>
				<li>Directive leadership: Leaders who promote a specific agenda can stifle dissent</li>
				<li>Stressful situations: High-pressure environments can lead to a desire for quick consensus</li>
				<li>Lack of Diversity: Homogeneous groups with similar backgrounds struggle to see alternatives</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Consequences</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>Poor decision-making: Critical information may be ignored, leading to flawed outcomes</li>
				<li>Lack of innovation: Dissenting ideas that could lead to better solutions are suppressed</li>
				<li>Ethical lapses: The group may engage in unethical behavior due to a lack of critical oversight</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Solutions</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>Encourage open dialogue: Foster an environment where dissenting opinions are valued</li>
				<li>Appoint a devil's advocate: Assign someone to intentionally challenge group ideas</li>
				<li>Seek external input: Bring in outside perspectives to provide fresh insights</li>
				<li>Break into smaller groups: Divide the group to discuss issues separately before reconvening</li>
				<li>Promote diversity: Include members with different backgrounds and viewpoints to enhance critical thinking</li>
				<li>Establish clear decision-making processes: Define how decisions will be made to avoid pressure for conformity</li>
				<li>Regularly review decisions: Reassess group decisions to ensure they remain valid over time</li>
				<li>Foster a culture of critical thinking: Encourage members to question assumptions and evaluate evidence objectively</li>
				<li>Use anonymous feedback mechanisms: Allow members to express concerns without fear of reprisal</li>
				<li>Rotate leadership roles: Change leaders periodically to prevent dominance by a single perspective</li>
				<li>Implement structured decision-making techniques: Use methods like the Delphi technique or nominal group technique to gather diverse opinions systematically</li>
				<li>Conduct post-decision evaluations: Analyze outcomes to learn from mistakes and improve future decision-making processes</li>
			</ul>
