            <p class="intro-text">The halo effect is a cognitive bias where our overall impression of a person, product, or brand influences how we perceive their specific traits or qualities. When we view someone or something positively in one aspect, we tend to assume they possess other positive qualities, even without evidence to support those assumptions.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">The halo effect manifests in various aspects of our daily lives and professional environments.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Hiring Decisions Based on Attractiveness</h3>
                <p>Research has shown that physically attractive candidates are often perceived as more competent, intelligent, and qualified for positions, even when their actual skills and experience may be similar to less attractive candidates. This bias can lead to unfair hiring practices and missed opportunities for talented individuals.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Celebrity Endorsements</h3>
                <p>Companies leverage the halo effect when they use celebrities to endorse products. A famous athlete's success in sports may create a positive halo that makes consumers believe the products they endorse are also superior, even though the celebrity may have no expertise in that product category.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">While the halo effect is a natural cognitive tendency, we can take steps to minimize its impact on our decision-making.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Structured Evaluations</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Use standardized criteria:</strong> Develop specific, measurable criteria for evaluating people, products, or situations</li>
                    <li><strong>Separate different dimensions:</strong> Evaluate each trait or quality independently rather than allowing one positive or negative aspect to color your entire judgment</li>
                    <li><strong>Blind assessments:</strong> When possible, remove identifying information that could trigger halo effects, such as names, photos, or institutional affiliations</li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple evaluators:</strong> Involve diverse perspectives in evaluation processes to balance individual biases</li>
                    <li><strong>Document your reasoning:</strong> Write down the specific evidence supporting each evaluation to ensure you're basing judgments on facts rather than impressions</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- Summary -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Summary</h2>
            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The halo effect causes us to let one positive trait overshadow our judgment of other, unrelated qualities. By implementing structured evaluation processes and consciously separating different dimensions of assessment, we can make more objective and fair decisions in both personal and professional contexts.</p>
