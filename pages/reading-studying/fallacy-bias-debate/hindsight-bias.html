            <p class="intro-text">Hindsight bias is the tendency to perceive past events as having been more predictable than they actually were. After an outcome is known, people often believe they "knew it all along," overestimating their ability to have predicted the event before it occurred. This bias distorts our memory of what we actually knew and thought at the time, leading to false confidence in our predictive abilities.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Hindsight bias affects how we interpret past events across many domains.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Stock Market Predictions</h3>
                <p>After a stock crashes or soars, investors often claim they "saw it coming," even though they took no action to capitalize on or avoid the outcome. This false sense of predictability can lead to overconfidence in future investment decisions and a failure to learn from actual mistakes.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Sports Outcomes</h3>
                <p>Following a major upset or championship victory, fans and commentators frequently assert that the outcome was "obvious" based on various factors, conveniently forgetting the uncertainty and diverse predictions that existed before the game. This can lead to unfair criticism of coaches and players who made reasonable decisions given the information available at the time.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Combating hindsight bias requires deliberate practices to preserve accurate records of our thinking and expose ourselves to alternative perspectives.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Documentation</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Record predictions:</strong> Write down your predictions and reasoning before events occur, creating an objective record of your actual expectations</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep decision journals:</strong> Document the information available at the time of important decisions and your thought process</li>
                    <li><strong>Review past assessments:</strong> Regularly revisit your predictions to calibrate your confidence and identify patterns in your forecasting abilities</li>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Diverse Perspectives</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Consider alternative outcomes:</strong> Before settling on a "that was inevitable" conclusion, actively think about how events could have unfolded differently</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek contradicting evidence:</strong> Look for information that would have supported different outcomes</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice humility:</strong> Acknowledge the role of uncertainty and luck in outcomes, rather than assuming perfect predictability</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Hindsight bias creates a false sense of predictability about past events, making us overconfident in our ability to forecast the future. By documenting our predictions before outcomes are known and actively considering alternative scenarios, we can develop more accurate self-assessment and make better decisions going forward.</p>
