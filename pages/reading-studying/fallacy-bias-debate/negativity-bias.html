            <h2 class="main-point">Definition</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Negativity bias is the tendency to give more psychological weight to negative experiences, information, and emotions than to positive ones. Even when positive and negative experiences are of equal intensity, the negative ones have a greater impact on our psychological state, memories, and decision-making. This bias evolved as a survival mechanism—paying more attention to threats helped our ancestors avoid danger—but in modern life, it can contribute to anxiety, pessimism, and distorted perceptions.</p>

            <p class="intro-text">Negativity bias influences how we process and respond to feedback in various contexts.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Feedback Reception</h3>
                <p>When receiving a performance review that contains nine pieces of positive feedback and one criticism, people typically fixate on the single negative comment and may barely remember the positive points. The criticism has a disproportionate impact on mood, self-perception, and memory of the evaluation. Research suggests it takes approximately five positive interactions to counterbalance one negative interaction in relationships and workplace dynamics.</p>

            <p class="intro-text">Counteracting negativity bias requires deliberate practices to balance our attention and emotional responses.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Gratitude Practices</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Gratitude journaling:</strong> Daily write down three things you're grateful for to train your brain to notice positive aspects of life</li>
                    <li><strong>Savor positive experiences:</strong> When something good happens, pause and consciously appreciate it for several moments rather than quickly moving on</li>
                    <li><strong>Share good news:</strong> Tell others about positive experiences to reinforce their impact on your memory and emotions</li>
                    <li><strong>Three-to-one rule:</strong> For every negative thought, deliberately identify three positive aspects of the situation</li>
                    <li><strong>Positive reflection:</strong> End each day by reviewing what went well rather than ruminating on problems</li>
                    <li><strong>Reframe criticism:</strong> When receiving negative feedback, actively remind yourself of recent positive feedback and accomplishments</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenge negative thoughts:</strong> When you notice yourself dwelling on negative events, question whether you're giving them disproportionate weight</li>
                    <li><strong>Mindful awareness:</strong> Notice when negativity bias is active without judging yourself, and gently redirect attention to a more balanced perspective</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Negativity bias causes negative experiences to have a disproportionately strong impact on our thoughts, emotions, and memories compared to positive experiences. By practicing gratitude, savoring positive moments, and consciously rebalancing our attention, we can counteract this bias and develop a more accurate and balanced perspective on our lives.</p>
