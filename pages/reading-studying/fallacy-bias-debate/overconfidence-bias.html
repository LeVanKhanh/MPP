            <p class="intro-text">Overconfidence bias is the tendency to overestimate our own abilities, knowledge, and the accuracy of our predictions. This cognitive bias manifests in three main forms: overestimating our actual performance, overplacing our performance relative to others, and excessive certainty in the accuracy of our beliefs. It can lead to poor decision-making, inadequate preparation, and increased risk-taking.</p>

        <!-- Examples -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Overconfidence bias affects critical decisions across personal and professional domains.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Financial Investments</h3>
                <p>Individual investors often overestimate their ability to pick winning stocks or time the market, leading to excessive trading, insufficient diversification, and poor returns. Studies show that professional fund managers, despite their expertise, also frequently exhibit overconfidence, with most actively managed funds underperforming index funds over the long term.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Project Management</h3>
                <p>The planning fallacy, a manifestation of overconfidence, causes project managers to underestimate the time, costs, and resources needed to complete projects. This leads to missed deadlines, budget overruns, and unrealistic commitments. Famous examples include the Sydney Opera House, which took 14 years to build instead of the planned 4 years, and cost 14 times the original budget.</p>

        <!-- Mitigation Strategies -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Reducing overconfidence requires systematic approaches to calibrate our self-assessment and predictions.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Seek Feedback</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Test your knowledge:</strong> Regularly assess your actual knowledge and skills through objective measures, not just self-assessment</li>
                    <li><strong>Track your predictions:</strong> Keep a record of your forecasts and their outcomes to calibrate your confidence levels over time</li>
                    <li><strong>Consult experts:</strong> Seek input from people with relevant expertise before making important decisions</li>
                    <li><strong>Encourage dissenting views:</strong> Actively invite criticism and alternative perspectives on your ideas and plans</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Probabilistic Thinking</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Express uncertainty in ranges:</strong> Instead of single-point estimates, use ranges (e.g., "this will take 3-5 weeks" rather than "this will take 3 weeks")</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider base rates:</strong> Look at how similar projects or predictions have turned out in the past before making your own forecast</li>
                    <li><strong>Pre-mortem analysis:</strong> Before starting a project, imagine it has failed and work backward to identify potential causes</li>
                    <li><strong>Use reference class forecasting:</strong> Base your predictions on actual outcomes of similar past endeavors rather than your intuitive assessment</li>
                    <li><strong>Assign probabilities:</strong> Force yourself to quantify uncertainty by assigning percentage probabilities to different outcomes</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- Summary -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Summary</h2>
            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Overconfidence bias causes us to overestimate our abilities and the accuracy of our predictions, leading to poor decisions and unrealistic plans. By actively seeking feedback, tracking our prediction accuracy, and thinking in probabilities rather than certainties, we can better calibrate our confidence to match reality and make more sound decisions.</p>
