            <p class="intro-text">Selective perception is the tendency to perceive and interpret information in ways that align with our existing beliefs, expectations, and attitudes while filtering out or downplaying contradictory information. This cognitive bias acts as a lens through which we view the world, causing us to notice and remember information that confirms what we already believe while overlooking information that challenges our preconceptions.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Selective perception shapes how we interpret information across various contexts.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Political Views</h3>
                <p>People with strong political affiliations tend to interpret the same news events in radically different ways based on their pre-existing beliefs. A political speech may be perceived as inspiring leadership by supporters and dangerous demagoguery by opponents, with each group selectively focusing on different aspects of the same content. This contributes to political polarization and makes constructive dialogue across party lines increasingly difficult.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Workplace Feedback</h3>
                <p>Employees who believe they're undervalued may interpret neutral or even positive feedback as criticism, while those who feel secure may overlook genuine constructive criticism. A manager's comment about "room for improvement" might be perceived as an attack by one employee and helpful guidance by another, depending on their pre-existing beliefs about their standing in the organization.</p>

        <!-- Mitigation Strategies -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Overcoming selective perception requires actively seeking information that challenges our assumptions.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Seek Diverse Perspectives</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Consume diverse media:</strong> Deliberately expose yourself to news sources, commentators, and writers who hold different viewpoints from your own</li>
                    <li><strong>Engage with opposing views:</strong> Rather than dismissing arguments you disagree with, try to understand the reasoning behind them</li>
                    <li><strong>Build diverse networks:</strong> Cultivate relationships with people from different backgrounds, industries, and belief systems</li>
                    <li><strong>Devil's advocate:</strong> When forming opinions, actively argue the opposite position to identify weaknesses in your own thinking</li>
                    <li><strong>Ask "what would change my mind?":</strong> Identify what evidence or arguments would cause you to revise your beliefs</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice intellectual humility:</strong> Acknowledge that your perceptions are inherently filtered through your biases and may not represent objective reality</li>
                    <li><strong>Separate facts from interpretation:</strong> Distinguish between objective information and your subjective interpretation of that information</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Selective perception causes us to see what we expect to see, filtering reality through our existing beliefs and expectations. By actively seeking diverse perspectives, engaging with opposing viewpoints, and questioning our interpretations, we can develop a more balanced and accurate understanding of complex situations.</p>
