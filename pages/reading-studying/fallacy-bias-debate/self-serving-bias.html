            <h2 class="main-point">Definition</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Self-serving bias is the tendency to attribute positive outcomes to our own abilities, efforts, or character while blaming negative outcomes on external circumstances, bad luck, or other people. This bias helps protect our self-esteem but can prevent us from learning from mistakes and accurately assessing our performance.</p>

        <!-- Examples -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Self-serving bias appears in how we interpret our successes and failures across different contexts.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Academic Performance</h3>
                <p>Students who receive good grades often attribute their success to their intelligence and hard work. However, when they perform poorly, they're more likely to blame the difficulty of the test, the teacher's poor instruction, or distractions beyond their control. This pattern prevents them from identifying areas where they need to improve their study habits or seek help.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Workplace Success</h3>
                <p>In professional settings, employees may credit successful projects to their leadership, skills, and dedication while attributing failures to inadequate resources, unrealistic deadlines, or uncooperative colleagues. Managers might similarly take credit for team successes while distancing themselves from team failures, which can harm morale and prevent organizational learning.</p>

        <!-- Mitigation Strategies -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Overcoming self-serving bias requires honest self-assessment and openness to external feedback.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Self-Reflection</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Conduct honest post-mortems:</strong> After both successes and failures, systematically analyze what factors contributed to the outcome, including your own actions and decisions</li>
                    <li><strong>Acknowledge external help:</strong> When you succeed, recognize the contributions of others, favorable circumstances, and good timing alongside your own efforts</li>
                    <li><strong>Accept personal responsibility:</strong> When things go wrong, look for what you could have done differently before blaming external factors</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintain a balanced perspective:</strong> Recognize that most outcomes result from a combination of internal and external factors</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Feedback Seeking</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Request constructive criticism:</strong> Actively ask others for honest feedback about your performance and areas for improvement</li>
                    <li><strong>Listen without defensiveness:</strong> When receiving feedback, resist the urge to make excuses or deflect blame</li>
                    <li><strong>Compare self-assessment with others' views:</strong> Regularly check whether your self-perception aligns with how others perceive your contributions</li>
                    <li><strong>Create accountability structures:</strong> Work with mentors or peers who will provide honest, objective assessments of your performance</li>
                </ul>

        <!-- Summary -->
        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Summary</h2>
            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Self-serving bias protects our ego by attributing success to ourselves and failure to external factors, but this pattern prevents genuine learning and growth. By practicing honest self-reflection and actively seeking objective feedback, we can develop a more accurate understanding of our strengths and weaknesses, leading to better performance and stronger relationships.</p>
