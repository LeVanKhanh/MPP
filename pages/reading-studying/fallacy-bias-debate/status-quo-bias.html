            <p class="intro-text">Status quo bias is the tendency to prefer the current state of affairs and resist change, even when change might lead to better outcomes. This cognitive bias makes us disproportionately value what we currently have or what currently exists, leading us to stick with default options, maintain existing habits, and avoid making decisions that would alter our current situation. The bias is rooted in loss aversion—we fear potential losses from change more than we value potential gains.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Investment Choices</h3>
                <p>Investors often hold onto poorly performing stocks rather than selling them and reallocating to better opportunities. They maintain their current portfolio allocation even when their financial situation, goals, or market conditions have changed significantly. Many employees also fail to optimize their retirement accounts, sticking with default investment options even when better alternatives are available, simply because changing requires effort and decision-making.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">Overcoming status quo bias requires actively questioning current arrangements and systematically evaluating alternatives.</p>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Evaluate Alternatives</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Regular reviews:</strong> Schedule periodic reviews of important decisions, subscriptions, investments, and habits to assess whether they still serve you</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero-based thinking:</strong> Ask yourself, "If I were starting fresh today, would I make this same choice?" If not, consider making a change</li>
                    <li><strong>Quantify costs of inaction:</strong> Explicitly calculate what maintaining the status quo is costing you in time, money, or opportunity</li>
                    <li><strong>Set decision deadlines:</strong> Give yourself a specific deadline to make decisions rather than indefinitely postponing changes</li>
                    <li><strong>Experiment with changes:</strong> Test alternatives on a trial basis to reduce the perceived risk of change</li>
                    <li><strong>Seek external perspective:</strong> Ask others whether your current situation makes sense, as they're less emotionally attached to your status quo</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on gains, not just losses:</strong> Consciously consider what you might gain from change, not just what you might lose</li>
                    <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Make small changes to build confidence and reduce the anxiety associated with altering your current state</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="main-point">Summary</h2>
            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Status quo bias causes us to irrationally prefer current arrangements simply because they are current, often missing opportunities for improvement. By regularly reviewing our choices, asking whether we would make the same decision today, and systematically evaluating alternatives, we can overcome inertia and make decisions that better serve our evolving needs and circumstances.</p>
