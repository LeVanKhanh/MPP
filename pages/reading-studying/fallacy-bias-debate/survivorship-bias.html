			<h2 class="main-point">Definition</h2>
			<p class="intro-text">Survivorship bias is a cognitive bias that occurs when individuals focus on successful examples or "survivors" of a particular process while ignoring those that did not succeed, leading to distorted conclusions about the factors contributing to success.</p>

			<h2 class="main-point">Examples</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Business Success:</strong> Analyzing successful companies without considering the many that failed can lead to incorrect assumptions about what drives business success</li>
				<li><strong>Military Strategy (WWII):</strong> Analyzing only the planes that returned from missions led to flawed reinforcement strategies, as the planes that were shot down were not considered—a classic example that revolutionized the understanding of this bias</li>
				<li><strong>Investment Strategies:</strong> Focusing on successful investors without accounting for those who lost money can skew perceptions of effective investment approaches</li>
				<li><strong>Entrepreneurial Advice:</strong> Highlighting successful entrepreneurs while ignoring the many who failed can lead to unrealistic expectations about starting a business</li>
			</ul>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Causes</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li><strong>Selection Bias:</strong> Focusing on a non-representative sample of successful cases</li>
				<li><strong>Cognitive Simplification:</strong> The brain's tendency to create narratives based on available information</li>
			</ul>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Consequences</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>Misguided Strategies: Decisions based on incomplete data can lead to ineffective approaches</li>
				<li>Overestimation of Success Factors: Incorrectly attributing success to certain traits or actions</li>
				<li>Ignoring Risks: Failure to recognize the challenges and failures that contribute to overall outcomes</li>
			</ul>

		<section class="content-section">
			<h2 class="main-point">Mitigation Strategies</h2>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>Awareness and Education: Inform individuals about survivorship bias to promote critical evaluation</li>
				<li>Comprehensive Data Analysis: Consider both successful and unsuccessful cases when drawing conclusions</li>
				<li>Seek Diverse Perspectives: Engage with individuals who can provide insights into failures as well as successes</li>
				<li>Use Statistical Methods: Apply rigorous statistical techniques to account for selection bias in analyses</li>
			</ul>

				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Key Takeaway</h3>
				<p>Survivorship bias teaches us to look at the complete picture, including failures and unsuccessful attempts. The famous WWII aircraft example shows that sometimes the most valuable information comes from what didn't survive, not just what did.</p>
