            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li>Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment.</li>
                <li>When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.</li>
                <li>Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.</li>
                <li>Instead of condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try to figure out why they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. "To know all is to forgive all".</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Principle 1:</strong> Don't criticize, condemn or complain.</p>

            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li>Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: The sex urge and the desire to be great.</li>
                <li>The hogs didn't care about the ribbons they had won. But father did. These prizes gave him a feeling of importance.</li>
                <li>If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character.</li>
                <li>"I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people," said Schwab, "the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement."</li>
                <li>Emerson said: "Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him."</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="summary-box">
                <p><strong>Principle 2:</strong> Give honest and sincere appreciation.</p>

            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li>So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.</li>
                <li>Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: "How can I make this person want to do it?"</li>
                <li>"If there is any one secret of success," said Henry Ford, "it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own."</li>
