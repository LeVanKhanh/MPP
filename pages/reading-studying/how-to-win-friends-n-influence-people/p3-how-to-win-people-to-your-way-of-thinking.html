                <li>Welcome the disagreement</li>
                <li>Distrust your first instinctive impression</li>
                <li>Control your temper</li>
                <li>Listen first</li>
                <li>Look for areas of agreement</li>
                <li>Be honest</li>
                <li>Promise to think over your opponents's ideas and study them carefully</li>
                <li>Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest</li>
                <li>Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem</li>
