            <ul class="outline-list">
            <li><strong>Ask open questions:</strong> Invite fuller answers and new perspectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Favor how-questions over why-questions:</strong> "How" keeps the focus on creative, forward steps; "why" often drifts into blame or post-mortems.</li>
            <li><strong>Set your own thoughts aside:</strong> Stay neutral and explore the other person’s view of the situation.</li>
            <li><strong>Be genuinely interested:</strong> Curiosity builds trust and encourages candid sharing.</li>
            <li><strong>Align your intention:</strong> Be clear you are there to help them think, not to win or direct.</li>
            <li><strong>Paraphrase:</strong> Reflect back what you hear to confirm understanding and surface nuances.</li>
            <li><strong>Offer suggestions only if they are stuck:</strong> Coach the thinking process first; contribute ideas sparingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Help them find their own suggestions:</strong> Prompt them to generate options and choose their path.</li>
            <li><strong>Notice body language (yours and theirs):</strong> Posture, tone, and pace often reveal more than words.</li>
            <li><strong>Set timeframes:</strong> Bound the conversation and agree on timelines for actions or follow-ups.</li>
