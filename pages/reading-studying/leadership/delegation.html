            <li>Your team will reach better results.</li>
            <li>It lessens your burden and frees time for strategic work.</li>

            <h2 class="main-point">Which Tasks to Delegate</h2>
            <ul class="outline-list">
            <li><strong>Low effort - High skill:</strong> Often do these yourself; low effort, high expertise—can be a good use of your time.</li>
            <li><strong>High effort - High skill:</strong> Delegate as longer projects to skilled people (or those who can be trained). Expect more involvement early, less later.</li>
            <li><strong>Low effort - Low skill:</strong> Delegate by default; many can do these and keeping them yourself wastes time.</li>
            <li><strong>High effort - Low skill:</strong> Delegate when possible to lower-competence team members as stepping stones for them and for your delegation practice.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2 class="main-point">Four Questions Before Delegating</h2>
            <ul class="outline-list">
            <li>Is there someone who has (or can be given) the required knowledge or experience?</li>
            <li>Does the task offer growth or skill development for another person?</li>
            <li>Will this task recur in this or a similar form?</li>
            <li>Can you make time to delegate effectively (train, support, check progress, give feedback)?</li>
        </ul>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Who to Delegate To</h2>
            <ul class="outline-list">
            <li>Competence level.</li>
            <li>Current workload.</li>
            <li>Level of independence and ambition.</li>
        </ul>
            <p>Expect initial tasks to take longer for someone new than if you did them yourself.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">The Four Delegation Styles</h2>
            <ul class="outline-list">
            <li><strong>Instruct:</strong> For low-skill tasks; will may be high, skill is low.</li>
            <li><strong>Train:</strong> For some skill present; will may be lower, knowledge stronger.</li>
            <li><strong>Coach:</strong> For higher competence; guide rather than direct.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor:</strong> For highest competence; delegate results, not methods—let them choose how.</li>
