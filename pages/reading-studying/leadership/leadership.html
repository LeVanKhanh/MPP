            <ol class="numbered-outline">
                <li><strong>Nothing:</strong> Surface talk (e.g., weather); shallowest level.</li>
                <li><strong>Something:</strong> Talking about topics or events (sports, org chart, meetings, systems); still light depth.</li>
                <li><strong>Somebody:</strong> Talking about someone not present (boss, coworker, family); more direct and personal.</li>
                <li><strong>You and I:</strong> Deepest level; direct exchange between us (e.g., feedback) to develop trust and relationship.</li>

            <ol class="numbered-outline">
                <li><strong>Step 1: Sensation:</strong> What you experience with your senses.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 2: Awareness:</strong> Noticing and acknowledging the sensation.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 3: Insight:</strong> Making meaning (e.g., "I have too much to do at work").</li>
                <li><strong>Step 4: Action:</strong> Acting based on the insight.</li>
                <li><strong>Step 5: Effect:</strong> Owning the effects of your actions to build trust and credibility.</li>
