        <h2>The Difference Between Management and Leadership</h2>

        <h3>Management</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Position:</strong> Appointment from above in the organization.</li>
            <li><strong>Organizing things:</strong> Operates in the “things” dimension; a defined role.</li>
            <li><strong>Formal:</strong> Authority is formal and role-based.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Relationship:</strong> A vote of confidence from other people.</li>
            <li><strong>Relating, influencing:</strong> Operates in the relationships dimension.</li>
            <li><strong>Informal:</strong> Influence can be informal and earned.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Four Levels of Communication</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nothing:</strong> Surface talk (e.g., weather); shallowest level.</li>
            <li><strong>Something:</strong> Talking about topics or events (sports, org chart, meetings, systems); still light depth.</li>
            <li><strong>Somebody:</strong> Talking about someone not present (boss, coworker, family); more direct and personal.</li>
            <li><strong>You and I:</strong> Deepest level; direct exchange between us (e.g., feedback) to develop trust and relationship.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Having a Clear Outcome</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Something easily gets missed:</strong> Entering conversations without a desired outcome creates drift.</li>
            <li><strong>To be an effective communicator:</strong> Make the desired outcome crystal clear to sharpen your communication.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>The Arrow of Credibility</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: Sensation:</strong> What you experience with your senses.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: Awareness:</strong> Noticing and acknowledging the sensation.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: Insight:</strong> Making meaning (e.g., “I have too much to do at work”).</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4: Action:</strong> Acting based on the insight.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5: Effect:</strong> Owning the effects of your actions to build trust and credibility.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Incompatible Strategies</h3>
        <p>Recognize when goals or approaches clash to choose an appropriate response.</p>
        <h3>The Five Conflict Styles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fight:</strong> Prioritize your needs first.</li>
            <li><strong>Adapt:</strong> Prioritize the other person’s needs, set your own aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Engage neither your needs nor theirs; step away.</li>
            <li><strong>Compromise:</strong> Each side gets something, but not all they want.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooperate:</strong> Seek to meet both your needs and theirs.</li>
