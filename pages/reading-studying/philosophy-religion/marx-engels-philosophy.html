                    <h4 class="sub-point-2">Principle of Universal Connection</h4>
                    <p>All things and phenomena always exist in interconnection, mutual interaction with each other. No thing or phenomenon exists independently or in isolation from other things and phenomena.</p>

                    <p>Development is upward movement from low to high, from simple to complex, from less perfect to more perfect. Development is the inevitable trend of all things and phenomena.</p>

                <div class="sub-section-nested">
                    <h4 class="sub-point-2">Law of Quantity - Quality</h4>
                    <p>Gradual quantitative changes reaching a certain limit (nodal point) will lead to sudden qualitative changes (leap).</p>
                    <ul class="outline-list">
                        <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> The specification in terms of number, scale, and degree of things</li>
                        <li><strong>Quality:</strong> The fundamental specification that makes a thing what it is and not another thing</li>
                        <li><strong>Nodal point:</strong> The limit where quantitative change leads to qualitative change</li>
                        <li><strong>Leap:</strong> The fundamental, sudden change in the quality of things</li>

                    <h4 class="sub-point-2">Law of Contradiction</h4>
                    <p>The source of development is internal contradiction within things. Contradiction is the unity and struggle between opposing aspects within each thing and phenomenon.</p>
                    <ul class="outline-list">

                    <p>Development proceeds in a spiral path, negating the old while inheriting and developing at a higher level.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sprout negates seed → Mature plant negates sprout → Fruit negates plant (but the fruit contains new seeds at a higher level)</p>
                    <ul class="outline-list">
                        <li><strong>Dialectical negation:</strong> Both affirming and denying; both inheriting and developing</li>

                        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Bringing things to a higher level</li>
