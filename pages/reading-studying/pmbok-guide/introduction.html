        <h2>Key Terms and Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> An end result or consequence of a process or project. Outcomes can include outputs and artifacts, but focus on the benefits and value the project aims to deliver.</li>
            <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> Projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.</li>
            <li><strong>Product:</strong> A quantifiable artifact that can be an end item itself or a component item.</li>
            <li><strong>Program:</strong> Related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.</li>
            <li><strong>Project:</strong> A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. The temporary nature indicates a beginning and an end to the project work or a phase of the work. Projects can stand alone or be part of a program or portfolio.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet requirements—guiding project work to deliver intended outcomes using predictive, hybrid, or adaptive approaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Manager:</strong> The person assigned by the performing organization to lead the project team in achieving the project objective—facilitating team delivery and managing processes to realize the outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Project Team:</strong> The group performing the project work. It may include roles beyond the core team (e.g., business representatives, suppliers) needed to deliver the outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>System for Value Delivery:</strong> The organizational network of portfolios, programs, projects, and operations that delivers value and enables strategy execution.</li>
            <li><strong>Value:</strong> The net benefit realized by stakeholders. Value can be tangible or intangible and is defined by the stakeholder context and expectations.</li>
        </ul>
