            <p class="intro-text">Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory distinguishes between factors that cause job satisfaction (motivators) and factors that cause job dissatisfaction (hygiene factors). These two sets of factors operate independently.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Factors for Satisfaction (Motivators)</h2>
            <p>Factors for satisfaction are called motivators. These are intrinsic to the work itself and lead to positive satisfaction.</p>
            
            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li><strong>Achievement:</strong> Sense of accomplishment and success</li>
                <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> Acknowledgment of contributions and efforts</li>
                <li><strong>The work itself:</strong> Interesting, challenging, and meaningful tasks</li>
                <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Autonomy and ownership over work</li>
                <li><strong>Advancement:</strong> Opportunities for promotion and career growth</li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Personal and professional development</li>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2 class="main-point">Factors for Dissatisfaction (Hygiene Factors)</h2>
            <p>Factors for dissatisfaction are called hygiene factors. These are extrinsic to the work and their absence causes dissatisfaction, but their presence does not necessarily motivate.</p>

                <li><strong>Company policies:</strong> Organizational rules and procedures</li>
                <li><strong>Supervision:</strong> Quality of management and leadership</li>
                <li><strong>Relationship with supervisor and peers:</strong> Interpersonal dynamics at work</li>
                <li><strong>Work conditions:</strong> Physical work environment and resources</li>
                <li><strong>Salary:</strong> Compensation and benefits</li>
                <li><strong>Status:</strong> Position and standing within the organization</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Job stability and safety</li>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Key Insight</h3>
                <p>Improving hygiene factors prevents dissatisfaction but doesn't create satisfaction. True motivation comes from the motivators - the intrinsic aspects of work that provide meaning, growth, and achievement.</p>
