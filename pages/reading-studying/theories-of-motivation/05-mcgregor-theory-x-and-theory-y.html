            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li>Dislike work and will avoid it if possible</li>
                <li>Must be coerced, controlled, or threatened to achieve goals</li>
                <li>Prefer to be directed and avoid responsibility</li>
                <li>Have little ambition and seek security above all</li>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Management Approach</h3>
                <p>Theory X leads to an authoritarian management style with close supervision, strict controls, and external motivation through rewards and punishments.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">Theory Y - The Positive View</h2>

            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li>View work as natural as rest or play</li>

                <li>Seek and accept responsibility under proper conditions</li>
                <li>Have the capacity to use imagination, ingenuity, and creativity in solving organizational problems</li>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Management Approach</h3>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Key Insight</h3>
                <p>McGregor believed that Theory Y assumptions were more valid than Theory X. He suggested that organizations should adopt Theory Y principles to create environments where employees can contribute their full potential and achieve both organizational and personal goals.</p>
