            <p class="intro-text">Alderfer's ERG theory of motivation builds on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and states that humans have three core types of need: Existence, Relatedness and Growth. These needs may be of different levels of priority for different individuals, and their relative importance for an individual may vary over time.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">Key Differences from Maslow's Theory</h2>
            
            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li><strong>Multiple needs can be active simultaneously:</strong> Unlike Maslow's hierarchy where lower needs must be satisfied first, ERG theory allows for multiple needs to motivate at the same time.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible progression:</strong> Individuals can move between need levels in any direction, not just upward.</li>
                <li><strong>Frustration-regression:</strong> If a higher-level need is frustrated, individuals may regress to focusing on lower-level needs that are more concrete and easier to satisfy.</li>
                <li><strong>Individual variation:</strong> The importance and priority of needs can vary significantly between individuals.</li>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Practical Implications</h3>
                <p>ERG theory suggests that managers should recognize that employees may be motivated by different needs at different times and should provide opportunities to satisfy all three categories of needs in the workplace.</p>
