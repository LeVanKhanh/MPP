            <p class="intro-text">Adam's equity theory of motivation insists there should be a fair balance between an employee's inputs and outputs. According to this theory, organizations can achieve strong, productive relationships between employees and employers if there is a balance between employee input and output.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">Employee Outputs</h2>
            
            <p>Outputs are what employees receive in return for their contributions, including both tangible and intangible items:</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">The Balance Principle</h2>
            
            <p>The theory states that:</p>
            
            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li><strong>When inputs match outputs:</strong> Employees feel motivated and satisfied at work.</li>
                <li><strong>When there is imbalance:</strong> The entire system experiences trauma or instability, leading to demotivation, dissatisfaction, and reduced productivity.</li>

                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li>Reduce their effort or input</li>
                    <li>Demand higher outputs (raises, promotions)</li>
                    <li>Compare themselves to others and feel resentment</li>
                    <li>Leave the organization</li>
                    <li>Rationalize the imbalance</li>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Key Insight</h3>
                <p>Managers should strive to maintain perceived fairness in the workplace by ensuring that rewards are proportional to contributions and by being transparent about compensation and recognition policies. Equity perceptions are subjective, so regular communication and feedback are essential.</p>
