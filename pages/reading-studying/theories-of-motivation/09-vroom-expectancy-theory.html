            <p class="intro-text">Vroom's expectancy theory states people's motivation depends on expectancy, instrumentality, and valence. He correlates these factors with workplace motivation. If an employee can make choices in their work, they will choose the element that motivates them most. That means employees rationally consider the relative attractiveness of all possible incentives and outcomes of an action. Besides, the individuals or the employees also consider how much performance and effort must be put in for that desirable outcome.</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">Three Elements of Vroom's Expectancy Theory</h2>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Expectancy</h3>
                <p>This is an expected outcome that employees look to get from their efforts. It is related to good performance. It is also connected with the level of difficulty and what the employee experiences.</p>
                
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li>Organizations should be focused on which factors can motivate the employee to get their best possible performance.</li>
                    <li>The theory states there is a correlation between performance and sources of motivation.</li>
                    <li>Victor Vroom claims that more efforts lead to better performance.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Key Question:</strong> "If I work harder, will my performance improve?"</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Instrumentality</h3>
                <p>Instrumentality means that employees will likely receive a reward if the performance expectation is achieved.</p>
                
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li>Organizations can motivate employees by making promises of extra rewards such as promotions or bonuses.</li>
                    <li>There must be a clear link between performance and rewards.</li>
                    <li>Trust in the organization's reward system is essential.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Key Question:</strong> "If I perform well, will I actually receive the reward?"</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Valence</h3>
                <p>Individuals value rewards based on their goals, needs, and sources of motivation. So, the value of rewards is differently perceived by individuals.</p>
                
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li>For example, some prioritize money, while others want recognition.</li>
                    <li>Some value work-life balance, career growth, or job security.</li>
                    <li>It is important to find out employee values to frame a source of motivation.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Key Question:</strong> "How much do I value the reward being offered?"</p>

            <h2 class="main-point">The Motivation Formula</h2>
            
            <p>According to Vroom, motivation can be expressed as:</p>
            
            <div class="summary-box">
                <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; margin: 1rem 0;"><strong>Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence</strong></p>
                
                <p>This means that all three factors must be present for motivation to occur. If any factor is zero, motivation will be zero.</p>

                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li>Ensure employees have the skills and resources to perform well (Expectancy)</li>

                    <li>Offer rewards that employees actually value (Valence)</li>
                    <li>Communicate openly about performance standards and reward systems</li>
