            <p class="intro-text">Frederick Taylor's Scientific Management Theory focuses on improving economic efficiency and labor productivity through systematic study and optimization of work processes. Taylor believed that workers are primarily motivated by financial incentives and that management should scientifically determine the best way to perform each task.</p>

            <ol class="numbered-outline">
                <li><strong>Breakdown job into subsets:</strong> Divide complex tasks into smaller, simpler components that can be analyzed and optimized.</li>
                <li><strong>Give responsibility and train workers:</strong> Provide clear responsibilities and thorough training to ensure workers can perform tasks efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Monitor performance:</strong> Continuously measure and evaluate worker performance against established standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Allocate jobs between managers and employees:</strong> Separate planning (management) from execution (workers) for maximum efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Pay based on results:</strong> Implement piece-rate pay systems where compensation is directly tied to output.</li>

            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li><strong>Selection based on skills and talents:</strong> An employee must be selected according to their skills and talents that match job requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Incentives and rewards:</strong> Apply incentives and rewards to improve output and encourage workers to perform better.</li>
                <li><strong>Scientific task implementation:</strong> Implementing techniques should be based on scientific analysis of tasks rather than rule-of-thumb methods.</li>
                <li><strong>Eliminate disruptions:</strong> Sensibly observe and eradicate disruptions when the plan runs to maintain smooth operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Standard leadership:</strong> Develop standard leadership practices to direct and achieve organizational goals.</li>

            <h2 class="main-point">The Four Principles of Scientific Management</h2>
            
            <ol class="numbered-outline">
                <li><strong>Science, not rule-of-thumb:</strong> Replace traditional work methods with scientifically determined best practices.</li>
                <li><strong>Harmony, not discord:</strong> Foster cooperation between management and workers rather than conflict.</li>
                <li><strong>Cooperation, not individualism:</strong> Encourage teamwork and collaboration to achieve organizational objectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Maximum output, not restricted output:</strong> Train and develop workers to reach their highest level of efficiency and prosperity.</li>

                <p>While Taylor's theory has been criticized for treating workers as machines and ignoring social and psychological needs, it laid the foundation for modern management practices including job analysis, performance measurement, and systematic training. Today's managers balance scientific efficiency with human-centered approaches that recognize workers' need for autonomy, recognition, and meaningful work.</p>
