            <p class="intro-text">Psychologist Albert Bandura has defined self-efficacy as people's belief in their ability to control their functioning and events that affect their lives. This belief system plays a crucial role in how people think, behave, and feel in various situations.</p>
            
            <p>One's sense of self-efficacy can provide the foundation for motivation, well-being, and personal accomplishment. When individuals believe they can succeed, they are more likely to take on challenging tasks and persist in the face of obstacles.</p>

                <img src="./images/Self-Efficacy_1.webp" alt="How Does Self-Efficacy Develop" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
            </div>
            
            <p>People's beliefs in their efficacy are developed by four primary sources of influence:</p>
            
            <ol class="numbered-outline">
                <li><strong>Mastery Experiences:</strong> The most effective source of self-efficacy. Successfully completing tasks builds a strong belief in one's capabilities, while failures can undermine it, especially if they occur before confidence is established.</li>
                <li><strong>Vicarious Experiences:</strong> Observing others successfully complete a task can strengthen beliefs in one's own abilities to accomplish similar activities. This is especially powerful when the observer identifies with the model.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Persuasion:</strong> When others express faith in one's abilities, it can strengthen self-efficacy beliefs. However, it's easier to weaken self-efficacy through negative feedback than to strengthen it through encouragement alone.</li>
                <li><strong>Emotional and Physiological States:</strong> Stress reactions and tension can be interpreted as signs of vulnerability to poor performance. Positive mood enhances self-efficacy, while anxiety and stress can diminish it.</li>
            </ol>

            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li><strong>Resilience to adversity and stress:</strong> People with high self-efficacy are better able to bounce back from setbacks and view difficulties as challenges to overcome rather than threats to avoid.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthy lifestyle habits:</strong> Strong self-efficacy beliefs support the adoption and maintenance of health-promoting behaviors.</li>
                <li><strong>Improved employee performance:</strong> Workers with high self-efficacy set higher goals, are more committed to them, and respond better to negative feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Educational achievement:</strong> Students with high self-efficacy are more likely to engage in challenging academic tasks and persist through difficulties.</li>
