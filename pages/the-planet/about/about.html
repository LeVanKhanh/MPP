    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am just an ordinary guy. I know I can not change the world — but I believe I can change myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now, I want to build a little planet of my own — a place where I can store what I have learned,
        capture what I think, and reflect on who I am becoming.
        Bit by bit, I will grow through each idea, each thought, each experience I hold onto.
    </p>
    <p>
        And maybe, one day, this little planet will reach a greater world. Maybe, from something ordinary, something extraordinary will begin.
    </p>

    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>I record what I learn and come to understand — to light the path ahead and nourish the soul within.</p>
    
    <h2>My Vision</h2>
    <p>To create a personal space that grows with me — a place to reflect, to dream, and to leave behind something meaningful.</p>
    
    <h2>My Core Values</h2>
    <ul class="core-values">
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> 
            I am not perfect — but I strive to be someone others can trust.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Courage:</strong> 
            Never give up. I choose to face challenges head-on — to be a warrior, not a worrier.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> 
            I believe in the power of working together. Shared goals, open minds, and mutual respect create something greater than what we can build alone.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Self-reflection:</strong> 
            I make time to pause, look inward, and understand my actions. Through reflection, I discover where I can grow — and how to make better decisions moving forward.
        </li>
    </ul>
