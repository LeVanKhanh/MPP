                I am just an ordinary guy. I know I cannot change the world — but I believe I can change myself.

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Building My Planet</h3>
                <p>
                    Now, I want to build a little planet of my own — a place where I can store what I have learned,
                    capture what I think, and reflect on who I am becoming.
                    Bit by bit, I will grow through each idea, each thought, each experience I hold onto.
                </p>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">The Journey Forward</h3>
                <p>
                    And maybe, one day, this little planet will reach a greater world. Maybe, from something ordinary, something extraordinary will begin.
