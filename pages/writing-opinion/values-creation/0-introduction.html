			<p>I write these lines not because I believe I have understood life, but because I am acutely aware of this: understanding, if not held in words, gradually fades and may disappear as if it had never existed.</p>

			<p>I am not sure how many people this book will help. For some, it may not be new; for others, it may not be deep enough. But I believe that, at the very least, it will be a guide written with seriousness and heart—something I can leave to my children and grandchildren in the future, as a foundation for them to understand that value does not arise on its own, and that life becomes meaningful when we create value for others.</p>

			<p>What is presented here is not a formula for success, nor a promise of an easy life. These are foundational principles that I believe can apply to most people—especially those who are struggling, without a frame of reference or clear guidance to define the path they wish to take and the goals they wish to pursue in life.</p>

			<p>This book is, at its core, a personal philosophy framework—not intended to replace any doctrine, but simply to reflect how I have learned to see, think, and act in response to the question of value.</p>
