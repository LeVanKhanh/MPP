            <!-- 1. Why “value” is not self-evident -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Why “value” is not a self-evident concept</h3>

                <p>We often speak a great deal about “value.” We are advised to live a valuable life, create value, and pursue the right values. In work, value is measured by performance; in society, by contribution; in personal life, by meaning. But what is notable is this: although the word “value” appears everywhere, we rarely stop to ask seriously what value truly is, and why something is seen as valuable in one context yet becomes meaningless—or even harmful—in another.</p>

                <p>An action may be praised today and condemned tomorrow. A tool may save lives in one person’s hands but cause harm in another’s. A belief once regarded as progressive may become a barrier when the context changes. If value were immutable and self-evident, such paradoxes would not exist.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- 2. Defining value in context -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">What value means in a real context</h3>

                <p>Value, in the context discussed here, is an abstract concept—but not a vague one. Something only becomes value when it creates real benefit or meaning for a particular subject, in a particular context, through consequences that can be felt or observed.</p>

                <p>Value, therefore, does not exist as a statement or intention, but is established by the impact it leaves in real life.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- 3. Forms and origins of value -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Forms and origins of value</h3>

                <p>We can speak of value in two broad forms: <strong>tangible</strong> and <strong>intangible</strong>. Tangible value refers to material or physical benefits—food, water, shelter, tools, and other objects that support life and function. Intangible value, on the other hand, lies in ideas, thoughts, philosophies, and understanding.</p>

                <p>Nearly every entity has its own inherent value. At the most basic level, from an ecological perspective, there is the value of existence. A living creature, simply by being born, already contributes to the continuity of life.</p>

                <p>When we create something—an object, an idea, an action—we also create value. Value arises whenever what we produce carries meaning or usefulness for someone or something else.</p>

            <!-- 4. Context dependence of value -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Value and its dependence on context</h3>

                <p>However, value is rarely absolute. An entity may be beneficial in one context while harmful in another. A tool that helps one person may endanger another.</p>

                <p>How many things do we still call valuable, simply because we have never placed them in a different context to reconsider?</p>

                <p>This question is not meant to deny existing values, but to remind us that the way we perceive value is often deeply influenced by our own familiar circumstances.</p>

            <!-- 5. Examples of value shifting with context -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Typical examples of value changing with context</h3>

                <p>The Internet is a typical example. For adults, it is an unprecedented space for learning, connection, and expanding knowledge. But for children, that same tool can become a source of danger if lacking guidance and supervision.</p>

                <p>Antibiotics were once regarded as one of humanity’s life-saving inventions. However, when abused or used incorrectly, they create antibiotic-resistant bacteria, threatening modern medicine.</p>

                <p>Similarly, guns can be seen as a means of self-defense in some circumstances, but become instruments of violence in others. The notion that children are the property of their parents also shows how the value of an idea can change as awareness and social context change.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- 6. A practical principle for evaluating value -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">A practical principle for evaluating value</h3>

                <p>To understand this complexity, we can apply a simple principle: <strong>if an entity creates more benefit than harm in a given context, we consider it valuable</strong>.</p>

                <p>This principle is not intended to establish an absolute standard, but only serves as a provisional tool for consideration in specific situations.</p>

                <p>From this understanding, the core question of creating value is no longer “how much have I done?”, but “what has what I done created, for whom, and under what conditions?” The following chapters will continue to delve deeper from this foundation.</p>
