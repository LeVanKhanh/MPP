                    Not every journey of creating value needs to leave a legacy.
                    And not everyone is obligated to expand their influence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This chapter does not impose a requirement, but opens a possibility:
                    when we are steady enough, clear enough, and still have surplus energy —
                    we can let the value we create continue to live <strong>beyond ourselves</strong>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Not required, only if possible</h2>
                <p>
                    Legacy should not be created out of pressure,
                    because any value born from obligation is quickly depleted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only when sharing, guiding, or recording no longer tires us,
                    but becomes a natural part of the journey,
                    can long-term impact have a chance to form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not everyone needs to leave a mark.
                    But if possible, do not let the value you have created disappear in silence.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Value beyond the individual</h2>
                <p><strong>Value grows larger when many people do it together</strong></p>
                <p>
                    One right action can create value.
                    But a right action repeated by many
                    creates impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Value reaches a new threshold when it:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No longer depends on a single individual,</li>
                    <li>Can be understood, applied, and continued by others.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    At that point, value does not just exist —
                    it begins to <strong>spread</strong>.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Leading by example</h2>
                <p><strong>Real images are stronger than any instruction</strong></p>
                <p>
                    People learn fastest not from advice,
                    but from seeing a viable path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Effective leadership does not require long explanations.
                    It requires consistency between:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>what we say,</li>
                    <li>what we do,</li>
                    <li>and the real results others can observe.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When you are the living evidence of what you share,
                    guidance no longer feels imposed,
                    but becomes an invitation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Mentoring</h2>
                <p><strong>Sharing so others go faster, not so they go like you</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Mentoring is not leading others down your path,
                    but helping them avoid unnecessary detours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knowledge and experience, when shared at the right time,
                    can help others:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>save time,</li>
                    <li>reduce mistakes,</li>
                    <li>and shape direction earlier.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A good mentor does not create copies,
                    but creates independent individuals —
                    people who can create value in their own way.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Documentation</h2>
                <p><strong>So value does not disappear over time</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Value that is not recorded depends entirely on memory —
                    and memory is not durable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Documentation does not need to be perfect.
                    It only needs to be clear enough so that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>others can understand,</li>
                    <li>those who come after can continue,</li>
                    <li>and we ourselves can return to learn from our past.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Each record is a way to resist forgetting.
                    And each document kept is an opportunity for value to continue,
                    even when its creator is no longer there.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Legacy is not about the scale of influence,
                    but about the ability for value to continue being created
                    when we are no longer directly involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your journey ends with you, that is not wrong.
                    But if you can leave something for others to continue,
                    that value will not only be useful —
                    it will <strong>live longer than you</strong>.
                </p>
