               <p>I once intended to write this chapter with real-life images of people who had succeeded. I thought that if we placed their lives alongside what was presented in previous chapters, we would see a fairly clear “formula”: they did this, therefore they achieved that.</p>

                <p>But the more I thought, the more I felt I needed to stop.</p>

                <p>Because what I just described can easily be personal bias: I see the world through my own frame of reference, then unconsciously fit real lives into the pattern I have already built. I might be “reading” other people’s success through my formula — not through their full reality.</p>

                <p>Therefore, I choose not to write this chapter as a list of illustrations. I leave it open — truly open — so that you, my dear reader, can observe and test for yourself: around you, are there people who have done similar things? How much of what is discussed here did they apply? And are they truly successful?</p>

                <p>Or perhaps you will see other paths: people who succeed through a completely different formula — even the opposite. If you see that, it is entirely wonderful. Because then you are no longer seeking confirmation for a pre-made pattern, but beginning to form your own path.</p>

                <p>In the end, the path of value is a personal one. Each person chooses a different way and method. Everything here should only be considered as reference.</p>

                <p>And knowledge or skill, in the end, does not lie in how much we hear from others — but in how we make it our own, or reach it through our own experience and choices.</p>
