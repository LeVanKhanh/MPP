            <p>A person truly becomes valuable when they create value, and life only gains meaning when it leaves something beyond itself. Our value does not lie in what we possess—knowledge, resources, or potential—but in how we transform those into benefits for ourselves and others. In this sense, value is not merely an external measure; it forms the foundation of identity and the direction of our life’s purpose.</p>
            <p>Many people spend their lives searching for life’s meaning. Rather than chasing an abstract, elusive answer, perhaps we should recognize that meaning is not something to be found but something to be created. Life becomes meaningful when we contribute, when we solve a problem, when we make something better than it was. Without creating value, human existence easily drifts, because meaning will not appear unless we build it.</p>
            <p>However, "creating value" here does not require visibility or recognition from society. In the Taoist philosophy of non-action, right action is not ostentatious; it flows naturally—work is accomplished without people noticing, society is ordered without feeling controlled. Such value is not measured by fame or achievement, yet it permeates daily life. It exists quietly and durably; precisely because it does not need to be named, it retains its enduring strength.</p>
            <p>Some perspectives hold that humans are not passive products of circumstances. Benjamin Disraeli once wrote: "Man is not the creature of circumstances. Circumstances are the creatures of men." This quote is not cited as a universal truth, but because it succinctly expresses a position consistent with the argument being presented here: the meaning and value of life are not bestowed from outside, but formed through how people act, choose, and engage with the world around them.</p>
            <p>Nguyễn Hiến Lê argues: "Life is inherently meaningless except for the meaning of reproduction, but humans must create a meaning for it." This is not a pessimistic stance; it hands people agency over their lives. The question is no longer whether life has meaning, but: how do we create it?</p>
            <p>In my view, life’s meaning is formed by creating value. When a teacher imparts knowledge, they do more than fulfill a professional role—they expand others’ thinking and future. When a musician or writer leaves works that move people, they step beyond personal life and engage with the community’s spiritual life. These values—tangible or intangible—are the clearest way a life gains meaning: not by how long it lasts, but by what it contributes during its span.</p>
            <p>This idea is expressed fully in the film Forrest Gump. I chose to borrow imagery from cinema instead of real-life cases because of the natural limits of observing reality. The movie does not directly answer “what is the meaning of life”; it shows that meaning arises not from abstract reasoning, but from the value created for others. Forrest does not live by lofty philosophy; he simply does what circumstances demand. Yet his simplicity repeatedly creates value: saving comrades, inspiring strangers, finishing a fallen friend’s dream, and helping Lieutenant Dan find a reason to live.</p>
            <p>Even Forrest’s material success does not stem from ambition or calculation, but as a natural result of persistently creating value. The shrimp boat he names “Jenny”—after the woman most deeply tied to his life—is a subtle symbol of this. The boat represents not only a successful fishing career, but also the continuation of love, memory, and loyalty he holds for Jenny, even as their lives repeatedly diverge.</p>
            <p>In the end, Forrest’s greatest value is not money or fame, but the family he builds—a safe harbor after all he has been through. Forrest Gump shows that the meaning of life is not about how deeply we understand it, but about what value we create, whose lives it touches, and how sincerely and steadfastly we do so.</p>
            <p>People can accumulate knowledge for a lifetime, but knowledge alone does not guarantee meaning. An idea, however profound, remains dormant if it stays in thought. Only when put into action does knowledge turn into value—when it builds, solves, or improves reality. Learning is not the destination; it is the starting point. Meaning lies not in what we know, but in what we do with what we know.</p>
            <p>This holds true not only for individuals but also for belief systems. Buddhism would be invisible without those who live and practice it. The Bible would be silent pages if not embodied in a life of faith. What would Marx–Engels philosophy be if it had never stepped out of books into the stream of history?</p>
            <p>Society runs on the exchange of value. Every relationship—from personal to professional—forms and endures because of what each side can offer the other. This is not about selfishness; value gives relationships a reason to exist. I do not advocate materialism, but “money” in the metaphorical sense—the value each person creates—quietly shapes how relationships and social systems function.</p>
            <p>In the workplace, this principle is most obvious. People are not paid for what they know, but for what they create from what they know. Organizations do not reward static knowledge; they reward realized results—improvements, solutions, and concrete progress.</p>
            <p>Before learning how to create value, it is more important to understand why we must do it. When the "why" is clear, the "how" stops feeling burdensome. Creating value, therefore, is not just a skill that can be learned, but a way of living—a way for people to place themselves in life intentionally, rather than drifting by inertia. Ultimately, a person's worth is not in what they hold, but in what they leave behind through the value they create.</p>
            <p>However, this does not mean that everyone must create monumental value or gain social acclaim. We create value not to become great, but to keep our lives from drifting. Value is also not measured by money or position: the wealthy do not inherently have more value than the poor, and those in higher positions do not automatically create greater value than those in lower positions. What matters is the value goal each person chooses, and the extent to which they live authentically by it. When a person creates value aligned with their own path, their existence has an anchor—and this anchor is the profound reason why creating value becomes unavoidable.</p>

                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Summary of Key Points</h3>
                <ul class="outline-list">
                    <li><strong>Meaning is created:</strong> Life gains meaning when we contribute and create value, not by waiting for meaning to appear</li>
                    <li><strong>Value need not be showy:</strong> Right actions can be quiet and enduring without social recognition</li>
                    <li><strong>Value comes from action:</strong> Knowledge or potential only becomes value when transformed through practical action</li>
                    <li><strong>Society runs on value exchange:</strong> Relationships exist because of the value parties provide each other</li>
                    <li><strong>Work pays for value created:</strong> Organizations pay for results and improvements, not for knowledge alone</li>
                    <li><strong>A clear “why” guides the “how”:</strong> Understanding why we create value makes the how feel lighter</li>
                    <li><strong>Value is not measured by money or status:</strong> Wealth or position does not guarantee more value; what matters is the value goal and authenticity to it</li>
                </ul>
