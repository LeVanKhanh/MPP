            <!-- 1. Value as the foundation of life’s meaning -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Value as the foundation of life’s meaning</h3>
                <p>A person truly becomes valuable when they create value, and life only gains meaning when it leaves something beyond itself. Our value does not lie in what we possess—knowledge, resources, or potential—but in what we transform from those into benefits for ourselves and others. In this sense, value is not merely an external measure, but the foundation that forms identity and orients each person’s purpose.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- 2. Meaning is created -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Meaning is not to be found, but to be created</h3>
                <p>Many people spend their lives searching for the meaning of life. But instead of seeking an abstract and elusive answer, perhaps we should recognize that meaning is not something to be found—it is something created. Life becomes meaningful when we contribute, when we solve a problem, when we make something better than before. Without creating value, human existence easily drifts—because meaning does not appear on its own unless it is built.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- 3. Value does not need to be visible -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Value does not necessarily need to be seen</h3>
                <p>However, “creating value” here does not mean it must be seen or recognized by society. In Taoist philosophy of non-action, right action is not ostentatious, but in accord with nature—work is accomplished while people hardly notice; society is governed without feeling intervened. Such values are not measured by fame or achievement, yet they permeate the order of life. They exist quietly and endure; precisely because they do not need to be named, they retain their lasting strength.</p>
                <p>Some perspectives hold that people are not passive products of circumstance. Benjamin Disraeli wrote: “Man is not the creature of circumstances. Circumstances are the creatures of men.” This is not cited as a universal truth, but because it succinctly expresses a stance aligned with the argument here: the meaning and value of life are not bestowed from outside, but formed by how people act, choose, and engage with the world around them.</p>
                <p>Nguyễn Hiến Lê wrote: “Life in itself is meaningless, except the meaning of reproduction, but humans must create a meaning for it.” This idea is not pessimistic; on the contrary, it gives people agency over their own lives. The issue is no longer whether life has meaning, but how we create it.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- 4. Value through action -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Value is formed through concrete action</h3>
                <p>In my view, life’s meaning is formed through the creation of value. When a teacher imparts knowledge, they do more than fulfill a professional role; they expand others’ thinking and future. When a musician or writer leaves works that touch people, they move beyond personal life to engage with the community’s spiritual life. These values—tangible or intangible—are the clearest way a life becomes meaningful: not because it lasts long, but because during that time it contributed something.</p>
                <p>Life’s meaning, therefore, does not have to be found in complex systems of thought or grand philosophical answers. Sometimes it appears most clearly in lives that seem simple, where people do not ask about meaning, but quietly create it through what they do for others.</p>

            <!-- 5. Forrest Gump example -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Forrest Gump — value comes from action</h3>
                <p>This idea is expressed quite fully in the film Forrest Gump. I chose to borrow an image from cinema rather than the life of a real person, because of the inevitable limits of observing reality. The film does not try to answer directly the question “what is the meaning of life,” but shows that meaning does not come from abstract thought, but from the values created for others. Forrest does not live by any lofty philosophy; he simply does what his circumstances place before him. Yet this simplicity repeatedly creates value: saving comrades, inspiring strangers, fulfilling a fallen friend’s unfinished dream, and helping Lieutenant Dan find a reason to keep living.</p>
                <p>Even Forrest’s material success does not come from ambition or calculation, but as a natural result of persistently creating value. The boat named “Jenny”—after the woman most deeply tied to his life—is a subtle symbol of that. The boat represents not only a successful fishing career, but also the continuation of love, memory, and loyalty Forrest holds for Jenny, even as their lives repeatedly diverge.</p>
                <p>In the end, the greatest value Forrest leaves is not money or fame, but the family he builds—a peaceful harbor after all that has passed. Forrest Gump shows that the meaning of life is not about how deeply we understand it, but about what values we create, whom those values touch, and how sincerely and steadily we do so.</p>

            <!-- 6. Value in knowledge and society -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Value in knowledge, thought, and society</h3>
                <p>People can accumulate knowledge all their lives, but knowledge by itself does not guarantee meaning. An idea, no matter how profound, if it exists only in thought, remains merely a dormant possibility. Only when put into action does knowledge transform into value—when it helps build, solve, or improve reality. Thus, learning is not the destination but the beginning; meaning lies not in what we know, but in what we do with what we know.</p>
                <p>This is true not only for individuals, but for whole belief systems. Buddhism would be invisible without those who live and practice it. The Bible would be only silent pages if it were not turned into a life of faith. And what would Marx–Engels philosophy be if it had never stepped out of books to appear in the flow of history?</p>
                <p>Society operates on the foundation of value exchange. Every relationship—from personal to professional—is formed and sustained by what each side can bring to the other. Not because of selfishness, but because value gives relationships a reason to exist. I do not advocate materialism, but “money” in the metaphorical sense—that is, the value each person creates—quietly shapes how relationships and social systems function.</p>
                <p>In the workplace, this principle appears most clearly. People are not paid for what they know, but for what they create from what they know. Organizations do not reward static knowledge, but realized results—specific improvements, solutions, and progress.</p>

            <!-- 7. Why it cannot be avoided -->
            <div class="sub-section">
                <h3 class="sub-point-1">Why creating value cannot be avoided</h3>
                <p>Before learning how to create value, it is even more important to understand why we must do so. When the “why” becomes clear, the “how” is no longer a burden. Creating value, therefore, is not just a skill to learn, but a way of living—a way for people to place themselves in life intentionally rather than drifting by inertia. In the end, a person’s worth is not in what they hold, but in what they leave behind through the value they create.</p>
                <p>However, that does not mean everyone must create grand values or be praised by society. We create value not to become great, but so that our lives do not drift. Value is also not measured by money or position: the rich do not automatically have more value than the poor, and those in higher positions do not necessarily create greater value than those in lower positions. What matters lies in the value goal each person chooses, and the extent to which they live truthfully with that value. When someone creates value aligned with their own path, their existence has an anchor—and that anchor is the deep reason why creating value becomes unavoidable.</p>
