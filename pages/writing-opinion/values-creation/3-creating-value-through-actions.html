			<p>This is an image I was given in childhood, passed down by elders and teachers. When I speak about value, I often borrow a familiar example from everyday life: ants and bees diligently carrying food and building their nests. These tiny creatures, through repeated and seemingly simple actions, create structures that are vast and durable over time.</p>
			<p>If we look at Earth as a gigantic ant nest or beehive, we humans are not so different—each person is a small life contributing to a system larger than themselves. From this perspective, not everyone needs to do something grand. It is enough to “bring food home” each day—in other words, to create a small but genuine value for our own “nest”.</p>
			<p>With this approach, I set aside—for now—factors like knowledge, social organization, or complex division of labor. I also temporarily bracket differences in circumstances, abilities, or living conditions. When a frame includes too many variables, it becomes unwieldy and obscures the core point. What I want to emphasize here is a minimal capacity most ordinary people share: the ability to create a small, regular, and truthful value through action.</p>
			<p>At that level, creating value is not complicated. It is as simple as bringing a little food home to our “nest” each day. From these small, repeated actions, larger value is formed—not by leaps, but by quiet accumulation over time.</p>
			<p>I recall a simple yet evocative story about a bricklayer. As he quietly places one brick upon the foundation, a passerby asks, “What are you doing?” Without looking up, he replies, “I’m building a castle.”</p>
			<p>What matters is not the brick in his hand, but how he sees his work. To an outsider, he is performing a repetitive, heavy, monotonous task. But to him, each brick is part of a larger structure—a meaning beyond the immediate action. That outlook turns everyday labor into a process of creating value.</p>
			<p>This story shows that value is not determined only by the scale of an action, but by the meaning a person attaches to it. Two people can do the same work, in the same circumstances, yet create entirely different lived experiences. One is merely “laying bricks”; the other is “building a castle.” The difference lies not in force, but in awareness of what one is creating.</p>
			<p>When people understand what they are building—large or small—their action no longer consumes time meaninglessly; it becomes part of a directed life. In such cases, value does not wait until the castle is complete; it begins with how the worker looks at the very first brick in his hand.</p>
			<p>An African proverb conveys a similar spirit, one I first encountered in The World Is Flat.</p>
			<p><i>“Every morning in Africa, a gazelle wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the fastest lion or it will be killed. Every morning in Africa, a lion wakes up. It knows it must run faster than the slowest gazelle or it will starve. It doesn’t matter whether you are a lion or a gazelle—when the sun comes up, you’d better be running.”</i></p>
			<p>The point worth pondering here is not who runs faster, but a simpler truth: there is no position that allows one to stand still. Whether predator or prey, strong or weak, every living being must act when a new day begins. In this context, “running” is not competition; it is the condition of continued existence.</p>
			<p>Viewed through the lens of value, this proverb reminds us: regardless of who we are, what role we occupy, or how many advantages we possess, sustaining life—and further, sustaining a meaningful life—requires disciplined, repeated action. Not running once, but running every morning. Not frantic bursts, but steady consistency.</p>
			<p>What we have already created—abilities, knowledge, relationships, achievements—does not maintain itself. Without continued action, these fade, much like a being that stops running on the savannah. In this sense, “death” is not necessarily biological; it is the loss of the capacity to keep generating value.</p>
			<p>These stories do not encourage endless rivalry; they point to a more foundational principle: value is formed and maintained through concrete action, repeated with discipline over time. When the sun rises, what matters is not that we outrun someone else, but that we are sufficiently alert and intentional to step into life through our own actions.</p>
			<p>Human life is often more complex than it appears. Not everything we believe to be value truly is. As noted in Understanding the Nature of Value, evaluating value must be placed within a concrete context. Going one step further, that requires an additional layer: wisdom.</p>
			<p>Action, by itself, is not enough to guarantee value. Only when guided by clear and sober wisdom can action create value in the proper sense. People sometimes produce things with good intentions, yet harm others or leave negative consequences for the future. Some values exist only for a moment, while others endure, transcending time.</p>
			<p>Wisdom differentiates between short-lived and lasting values. It helps us look beyond the immediate, weigh long-term effects, and choose more fitting ways to act. If we seek to create value responsibly and deeply, we must not only act, but also continually strengthen our knowledge and our capacity for thought.</p>
			<p>Human history shows that when action is guided by wisdom, even small things can open great turning points. A falling apple became the starting point for Isaac Newton’s discovery of universal gravitation—not because the apple was special, but because the observer was ready to think beyond the event itself.</p>
			<p>On a larger scale, the ability to combine wisdom with organization allows humans to create value that outlives a single lifetime. The Egyptian pyramids are one such example. They reflect systemic thinking, engineering, and organization that let an ancient society mobilize resources for decades to build structures that have lasted for thousands of years. Though born in a historical context very different from modern norms, the pyramids show that when wisdom is applied consistently and over the long term, it can generate value that endures through time.</p>
			<p>Similarly, the Panama Canal was not the product of a spontaneous act, but of decades of accumulated knowledge, organization, and long-horizon decision making. The project did more than shorten sea routes; it changed how the world conducts global trade—a reminder that when action is illuminated by wisdom, the value created can extend far beyond the initial goal.</p>
			<p>Yet here a question must be asked: do all products of human intellect automatically bring value? Hydropower dams, for instance, supply energy, drive economic development, and improve many communities’ lives. But they can also transform ecosystems, displace residents, and leave long-term impacts on the natural environment.</p>
			<p>These examples show that wisdom, though necessary, is not sufficient to guarantee value. Wisdom must be joined with contextual judgment, long-horizon thinking, and responsibility for what extends beyond immediate benefit. Through that discernment, value is defined—not only by what we create, but by how we choose to create it and accept the consequences that follow.</p>
			<p>Creating value does not begin with noble intentions, nor is it guaranteed by passing inspiration. Value appears when we enter life through concrete action, repeated long enough and steadily enough. But action, if not illuminated by wisdom, can produce results contrary to our hopes.</p>
			<p>Therefore, action is a necessary beginning—but never the end. Sustainable value is formed when action is tied to understanding, to seeing beyond immediate effects, and to bearing responsibility for what we produce. Only in that union does action truly become a path by which we build value and set our lives on a meaningful trajectory.</p>

				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Summary of Key Points</h3>
				<ul class="outline-list">
					<li><strong>Small, steady actions grow large value:</strong> Value accrues quietly over time; giant leaps aren’t required</li>
					<li><strong>Not grand—just genuinely contributive:</strong> Each person can add a small, truthful value daily to their “nest”</li>
					<li><strong>Perception gives action its meaning:</strong> “Laying bricks” vs “building a castle” reflects how we see and imbue work with meaning</li>
					<li><strong>Action is a condition of existence:</strong> Discipline and consistency matter more than momentary hustle</li>
					<li><strong>Value requires context to judge:</strong> Good intentions don’t ensure real value; assess concrete impacts</li>
					<li><strong>Wisdom guides action:</strong> Distinguish short-lived vs durable value; weigh long-term effects and responsibility</li>
					<li><strong>Sustainable value = Action + Understanding + Responsibility:</strong> Act continuously, look ahead, and own the impacts you create</li>
