			<p>To judge whether something we create truly carries value, the first consideration is ethics. Yet ethics is not a fixed standard; it bears the marks of history, is shaped by social context, and shifts over time and across cultures. Here I do not attempt to build a universal ethical yardstick for everyone. Instead, I present a personal viewpoint—a conscious bias—used as a basic measure for assessing value within my own reasoning.</p>

			<p>In thinking about ethics, I am often reminded of converging ideas across traditions: “Do not do to others what you do not want for yourself” (Confucius); Socrates’ view that “What angers us when others do to us, we should not do to them”; and Aristotle’s emphasis that a virtuous person places themselves in others’ position before acting.</p>

			<p>Though expressed in different contexts, these views meet at one point: our actions should not harm others. For me, this is the minimal but necessary ethical principle—a constant anchor to decide whether what we create is genuine value or merely benefit justified by outcomes.</p>

			<p>I will not delve into what happens if others ignore this principle or even choose to harm us. Each person operates from their own moral frame, influenced by experience, circumstances, and beliefs. Not everyone cares whether their actions hurt others. This is a real dilemma and a limit we must accept: we can hardly, if ever, change or control others’ actions.</p>

			<p>What lies within our control is how we choose to act. Rather than trying to adjust the outside world, I focus on inner development—building a consistent rule of action that does not conflict with my conscience even when it is not reciprocated. Ethics, in this sense, is a voluntary boundary we set for ourselves.</p>

			<p>Seen positively, if more people approach and choose the no-harm principle, benefits reach beyond individuals. A society where people self-limit their actions naturally becomes less conflict-ridden, more trustworthy, and more sustainable. Absolute consensus is unrealistic, but starting with oneself is the most feasible way to make ethics a real foundation for the value we create.</p>

			<p>Harming others’ interests is not only blatant and direct. In daily life, a small act—like burning trash that smokes—can irritate neighbors. Adjusting behavior, reducing impact, or simply asking permission prevents conflict and shows respect. These harms are easy to spot because their effects appear almost immediately.</p>

			<p>Not all harm is so visible. Some actions harm indirectly, quietly, and over time—like deforestation that erodes ecosystems and leaves long-term environmental consequences. Such effects often fall outside our immediate view and are easy to overlook, even without any intent to harm.</p>

			<p>This is where things get more complex. At the moment of acting, we cannot foresee every consequence. A seemingly small action can trigger a chain of effects far larger than we expected—much like the “butterfly effect,” where a tiny movement contributes to big changes elsewhere. The point is not the level of uncertainty itself, but the actor’s attitude toward that possibility.</p>

			<p>Therefore, when creating anything—large or small—careful reflection matters. Ethics here does not demand perfect prediction of outcomes; it asks for an alert mindset: awareness that our actions may extend beyond what we directly see, and thus must be carried out with caution, humility, and readiness to adjust when unintended effects surface.</p>

			<p>I intentionally stop at this simplest level. I do not discuss helping others, broader social responsibility, or obligations to intervene. Even “being responsible” or “helping” is complex and context-dependent, easily leading to unintended consequences. Not all help automatically creates value; uninformed or careless help can cause harm we never anticipated. Those questions are beyond the scope of this section.</p>

			<p>For me, adhering to the no-harm principle is enough to set a solid foundation. When value is created without infringing on others’ interests and without leaving obvious or latent negative effects, that value is more likely to endure and remain sustainable. From this minimal but consistent base, further development—whether personal or broader—can proceed more steadily and meaningfully.</p>

				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Summary of Key Points</h3>
				<ul class="outline-list">
					<li><strong>Ethics shifts with context:</strong> There is no absolute standard; this essay uses a conscious personal bias as the minimal gauge.</li>
					<li><strong>Minimum principle:</strong> Do no harm to others—a cross-cultural common ground and the baseline for judging value.</li>
					<li><strong>Internal control:</strong> We cannot control others’ ethics; what we can control is acting consistently with our own conscience.</li>
					<li><strong>Layers of harm:</strong> Harm can be direct and obvious or indirect and subtle; both must be recognized.</li>
					<li><strong>Cautious stance:</strong> Because outcomes are hard to foresee, actions need awareness, humility, and readiness to adjust.</li>
					<li><strong>Sustainable base:</strong> Following “do no harm” yields value that faces less conflict and endures longer.</li>
