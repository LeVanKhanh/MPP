			<p>For many years my life revolved around a familiar loop: eating, studying, and working. My job mostly meant sitting at a computer, typing for hours with almost no real movement. During that period my health quietly declined. I was often sleepy, tired, and felt I never had enough energy to do my work properly. Despite spending plenty of time working, the results did not match the effort.</p>

			<p>Back then I kept telling myself I had no time for anything else. Exercise felt impossible to schedule. What I failed to see was that the frail condition itself was draining my time and capacity. The more I tried to push through, the more exhausted my body became, and the clearer my thinking faded.</p>

			<p>The change started with a very small decision. I added 30 to 45 minutes of resistance training each morning—not to hit any specific fitness goal, just to move in a meaningful way. Over time I found my body stronger, my mind more alert, and my focus noticeably improved. Work did not consume more time; on the contrary, it flowed more smoothly and efficiently.</p>

			<p>That is only my personal experience, and I do not treat it as a template for everyone. But from it I draw a clear conclusion: people can create value—and do it sustainably—only when they are healthy enough to carry what they pursue. Health, in this sense, is not a trophy or a self-perfection target; it is the base condition that lets energy and clarity actually show up.</p>

			<p>We can also look back at the discussion in Creating Value Through Actions. When I used the image of having to "run" every morning—whether you are a lion or a gazelle—the focus was not on speed or competition but on the continuity of action. To keep "running" day after day, the prerequisite is a body strong enough to bear that rhythm. Without a minimal physical foundation, any call for discipline or persistence is fragile.</p>

			<p>Even on a spiritual path, health is indispensable. In Buddhism, the story of six years of ascetic practice by Prince Siddhartha Gautama illustrates this sharply. After years of self-denial in search of enlightenment, his body became emaciated and nearly devoid of life force. In that state, not only was his body damaged, his mental clarity also eroded.</p>

			<p>The moment Sujata offered a bowl of milk porridge—a nourishing food that helped him regain some strength—marked an important turning point. As his body was fed again, his mind gradually cleared. In that clarity he saw that extreme asceticism did not lead to liberation but was just another distortion. From this restored lucidity the Middle Way—avoiding both indulgence and self-mortification—took shape.</p>

			<p>This story suggests something worth pondering: even the pursuit of ultimate truth cannot be separated from basic bodily conditions. When the body is pushed to its limits, the mind struggles to stay clear enough to recognize the right path. In that sense, health does not oppose spiritual life; it is the quiet foundation that allows awakening to happen.</p>

			<p>Placed in the context of creating value, the lesson is even clearer. No one can sustain right action over the long term—whether in labor, creativity, or practice—if their body cannot support it. Health is not indulgence; it is the necessary condition to avoid extremes that exhaust both body and mind.</p>

			<p>If health is the physical base that keeps us moving, intellect—the clarity of mind—is the cognitive base that keeps those movements on course. A sound body lets us stand up to the pace of life, but only a clear mind helps us know where we are going and why we chose that path.</p>

			<p>In distinguishing right from wrong, ethical from unethical, or value from non-value, intellect is crucial. When perception is clouded, people drift—not out of ill will, but because they can no longer see the consequences of what they are doing. In that state, what we create can become meaningless or even harmful to ourselves and to those around us.</p>

			<p>Conversely, when the mind is clear, a person can decide for themselves without being swept away by pressure, emotion, or others' expectations. That clarity allows action with fuller awareness of consequences, and thus a readiness to own the results—for better or worse. In this sense, intellect is not only the ability to think clearly; it is the condition that lets us truly own our lives and the value we create.</p>

			<p>In Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People, the first chapter recounts a story about Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. When General Meade missed the chance to destroy the opposing army and let them withdraw safely, Lincoln was deeply disappointed and intended to write a scathing letter. In the end, he never sent it. Carnegie uses this to illustrate a familiar principle: "If you want to gather honey, don't kick over the beehive."</p>

			<p>Seen through the lens of intellect and value creation, Lincoln's choice shows sober calculation. Sending the letter might have vented his immediate anger but would create no lasting value. It risked damaging the relationship, undermining cooperation, and demotivating a key partner. By holding back his emotional reaction, Lincoln preserved an important resource—a general who continued serving the country at a critical time.</p>

			<p>This story shows that intellect is not only about acting correctly but also about refraining when an action adds no value. In many cases, stopping, exercising restraint, and choosing not to act—though fully capable—is the wise decision that protects value over the long term.</p>

			<p>The section on intellect will be explored in more depth in the next chapter, "Common Traps in Value Creation." There I will focus on common cognitive and reasoning pitfalls—blind spots that make people think they are creating value while actually veering off course. The aim of examining these traps is not perfect correctness but learning to think more clearly and cautiously before acting.</p>

			<p>I do not emphasize intelligence as an innate trait, because that is not something anyone can simply choose. I care more about how people can gradually improve their thinking—a capacity that can be trained, accumulated, and carried for life. In the journey of creating value, the ability to think clearly and soundly is the most durable piece of gear we have.</p>

			<p>In the end, the issue is not that people lack value or good intentions, but that they often overestimate their intent and underestimate the conditions required to live it out. When the body is not strong enough and the mind not clear enough, value—even when rightly chosen—can be distorted in the very process of being created.</p>

				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Summary of Key Points</h3>
				<ul class="outline-list">
					<li><strong>Health as a base condition:</strong> Weakness drains time, energy, and effectiveness; a healthy body enables continuous action.</li>
					<li><strong>Action needs a physical foundation:</strong> Discipline and endurance are fragile without minimal physical capacity.</li>
					<li><strong>Intellect guides direction:</strong> A clear mind distinguishes right from wrong and owns the consequences of action.</li>
					<li><strong>Clarity can be trained:</strong> Thinking can be improved; clear reasoning is the most durable asset for creating value.</li>
