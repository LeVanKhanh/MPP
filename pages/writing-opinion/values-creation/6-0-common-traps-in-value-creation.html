			<p>This section is not written to declare who is right or wrong. It is also not meant to criticize choices that once produced good results. What I want to discuss is more subtle: <strong>why people can go off course even while trying to do the right thing</strong>.</p>

			<p>In the process of creating value, mistakes rarely appear in a crude or obvious form. Most of them wear the face of reason, experience, goodwill, and even morality. We do not err for lack of effort, but because we trust too much that we have understood enough. We do not lose our way by intending to go wrong, but because familiar shortcuts of thought lead us to turn in another direction without realizing it.</p>

			<p>The traps discussed here are not simple logical errors, nor are they personal flaws. They are <strong>universal tendencies of human thought</strong>—ways the brain helps us react quickly, conserve energy, and preserve a sense of certainty in a complex world. That is why they do not appear when we are careless; they often appear when we are very serious.</p>

			<p>Each trap here shares one common point: it makes us <strong>conclude sooner than we should</strong>. We believe what is often true is always true. We confuse co-occurrence with causation. We defend existing beliefs instead of continuing to observe. We learn from what survived and forget what disappeared. We let emotion replace verification. And in all those cases, thinking does not stop—it simply runs along a familiar inertia.</p>

			<p>The danger lies not in any single trap, but in how they <strong>link together into a chain</strong>. An observation that is not yet mature can lead to a hasty conclusion. That conclusion, if it once brought results, quickly becomes a belief. When the belief forms, thinking starts to filter information to protect it. From there, what we see becomes narrower, while our sense of certainty grows larger. Value created in such a state may still exist—but it is often fragile, hard to adjust, and less sustainable.</p>

			<p>This section is not meant to make us doubt everything, nor to encourage extreme hesitation. Its purpose is simply to help us <strong>pause at the right time</strong>. Pause to recognize that what seems reasonable is not necessarily correct; what once worked is not necessarily still suitable; and what we believe may well need to be reexamined.</p>

			<p>Creating value is not only about doing more or doing better. Sometimes it begins with <strong>avoiding doing the wrong thing with certainty</strong>. And to do that, we need to understand not only what we should do, but also to recognize the mental ruts that can quietly lead us off course.</p>

			<p>The traps presented in this section are not to be avoided by memorization, but to be recognized with alertness. When we understand how our thinking can deceive itself, we do not become perfect—but we gain a chance to be more humble, flexible, and clear-minded in our own journey of creating value.</p>
