		<!-- 1. Purpose of the foundation section -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Why a thinking foundation is needed before discussing “traps”</h3>

			<p>In this section, I do not go deep into listing specific values that have been “trapped” or the mistaken consequences they created. What I care more about is how human thinking can be influenced, and how subtle distortions in perception can lead us to decisions that seem reasonable yet lack clarity. Only when we understand the mechanisms by which thinking goes off course can we find ways to build a stable cognitive foundation—so that creating value does not only come from goodwill, but is guided by alertness and genuine understanding.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 2. Mistakes are normal: the Einstein story -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Mistakes are not scary; what is scary is failing to recognize them</h3>

			<p>Albert Einstein once said: “I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times I come to wrong conclusions. The hundredth time I get the right conclusion.” This shows that even a mind regarded as genius is not immune to errors in thinking. The difference is not that Einstein made fewer mistakes than others, but that he was willing to go through errors, recognize them, and patiently adjust his thinking. Perhaps it is this caution in thought, seriousness about deviations in reasoning, and the ability to learn from wrong conclusions—rather than immediate correctness—that truly forms the foundation of great intellect.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 3. Natural tendencies that lead to deviation -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">A natural human tendency: convenience over correctness</h3>

			<p>People tend to choose convenience over correctness, leaning toward what is easy to access rather than what needs careful examination. We often trust what is familiar and close to our own experience more than we patiently seek what is closer to truth. Many decisions are made based on what is “already known,” on immediate intuition, or on subjective feelings, rather than a full and clear evaluation. These natural tendencies, when unrecognized, easily lead people to errors in perception and choice.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 4. Self-awareness of bias -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">No one stands outside bias</h3>

			<p>I do not stand outside those tendencies. I am quite aware of how the human brain operates—and I also understand that I am not immune to these biases. In writing, I always try to keep what is presented as neutral as possible and as reliable as I can. But absolute neutrality is likely only an ideal. What I can do—and what I choose to do—is be cautious about how I think, constantly question my own conclusions, and accept that even with great effort, subtle biases can still be present in each argument.</p>

			<p>So what should we do to reduce those deviations?</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 5. Step 1: stop reflex -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">The first step: pause to escape inertia</h3>

			<p>The first—and most important—step is learning to pause. Not to stop acting, but to stop reflex. Pause for a moment to question before making a decision, especially decisions driven by strong emotion, premature certainty, or a hard-to-explain sense of “obviousness.” In that pause, thinking has a chance to break free from its familiar inertia.</p>

			<p>This spirit has been noted early in intellectual history. Socrates warned that hasty thought leads people to wrong conclusions. Aristotle argued that a thoughtful person does not easily accept something at first contact. And centuries later, Albert Einstein humbly admitted: “It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.”</p>

			<p>Three different expressions, but pointing to one thing: the quality of thinking lies not in speed, but in the maturity of reflection. Pausing does not make us less decisive; it helps decisions rest on a steadier foundation. When we allow ourselves more time to think, to ask questions, to recheck initial assumptions, we actively create distance from familiar thinking traps—traps that often convince us we already understand enough, when in fact we only understand a part.</p>

			<p>Pausing, therefore, is not a sign of hesitation, but a sign of responsibility for what we are about to create.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 6. Step 2: listen -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">The next step: listen to understand the issue correctly</h3>

			<p>Next, we need to learn how to listen. Listening is not merely hearing, nor is it waiting for our turn to respond. Listening, in a deeper sense, is the effort to fully receive what others are expressing: what problem they see, where their real concern lies, and how what they want to convey may differ from how we currently understand it.</p>

			<p>Stephen Covey once said: “Learning to listen is the first step of critical thinking.” This points to a key link: without genuine listening, evaluation becomes only hurried judgment. Only when we understand the issue correctly—understand what is being said, rather than what we think is being said—can we weigh, critique, and make wiser decisions.</p>

			<p>Listening, therefore, is not passive or yielding, but an active act of intellect. It is how we set aside the ego for a moment to make room for more accurate understanding—an essential condition if we want to avoid thinking traps and create value in its true sense.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 7. Step 3: delay judgment and be patient -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Delay judgment: put intuition in its proper place</h3>

			<p>Even for matters where intuition tells us “something is wrong” right away, it is still necessary to suspend judgment. Instead of quickly labeling right or wrong, we can choose to note it, place it in an observation zone, and give ourselves time to examine it more carefully. Initial impressions can be useful, but if treated as final conclusions, they easily become thinking shortcuts—fast and convenient, but shallow.</p>

			<p>This caution does not deny intuition, but places it in its proper position: as a signal to be tested, not a finished verdict. Only when we allow enough time to view an issue from multiple angles do we gain the chance to distinguish between subjective feeling and the substance of the matter.</p>

			<p>Leonardo da Vinci said: “Patience is the foundation of clarity.” In thinking as well, clarity rarely appears in a rushed moment. It is often formed through the ability to delay judgment, accept uncertainty for a time, and stay with the issue until necessary connections gradually reveal themselves.</p>

			<p>Patience, therefore, is not slowness, but a way of respecting the complexity of reality—an important condition so that thinking does not fall into traps of oversimplification and rushed conclusions.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 8. Step 4: gather information and critique -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Gather information and critique: the essential tool is the question</h3>

			<p>After pausing, listening, and delaying judgment, the next step is to gather information and critically examine whether the issue is truly reasonable. Not to find evidence that confirms what we already believe, but to broaden the cognitive picture—wide enough to include points we have not considered.</p>

			<p>The most important tool in this process is not the answer, but the question. Galileo Galilei emphasized: “True knowledge is not memorization, but knowing how to ask the right questions.” A well-posed question can shake assumptions that seem obvious and force thinking to leave familiar ruts. In the same spirit, Albert Einstein said: “Critical thinking is the ability to challenge assumptions without fear of judgment.” Critique, therefore, is not about negating others, but about daring to re-examine the very foundation of one’s own thinking.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 9. Bias and difference -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Recognize bias and actively seek difference</h3>

			<p>However, asking questions and critiquing only become effective when we are aware of the biases shaping our thinking. These biases rarely appear as rigid beliefs; they hide in habits of thought, personal experience, or things “everyone knows.” Henry Ford said: “Creativity never happens in a mind filled with prejudice.” When thinking is locked by ready-made assumptions, new information is taken in selectively, and critique quickly becomes a formality.</p>

			<p>Therefore, along with removing bias, we need to actively seek difference—perspectives that do not match the way we currently think. Steve Jobs encouraged: “Think different if you want to achieve something different.” The difference here is not about expressing personality, but about opening new cognitive possibilities—possibilities that appear only when we dare to step outside the safe zone of familiar thinking.</p>

			<p>Gathering information, asking questions, critiquing assumptions, and seeking difference—none of these guarantee we will always reach the right conclusion. But they significantly reduce the chance of arriving at a wrong conclusion with certainty. And in the journey of creating value, avoiding major mistakes can sometimes be a valuable outcome in itself.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 10. Mistakes and how to face them -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Mistakes still happen: what matters is how we learn from them</h3>

			<p>And then, even after pausing, listening, being patient, gathering information, and critiquing carefully, we can still reason incorrectly. This can happen, and is almost unavoidable. Mistakes, in this case, are not signs of incompetence, but the natural result of people daring to think and draw conclusions in a world more complex than any individual can fully grasp.</p>

			<p>What matters is not avoiding every mistake, but how we face mistakes once they appear. When a line of reasoning is shown to be inaccurate, we can choose to deny, justify, or avoid. Or we can choose the harder path: accept it, review the thinking process that led to that conclusion, and learn from the points where thinking went off course.</p>

			<p>Thomas Edison said: “Every mistake is a valuable lesson for critical thinking.” In that spirit, mistakes are no longer something to hide or feel ashamed of, but important data—signals that help us understand our cognitive limits. By seriously learning from those mistakes, thinking has the chance to be refined, become more flexible, and fall less often into familiar traps in future attempts.</p>

			<p>Progress in thinking, therefore, is not a process of going from right to right, but a journey through many not-yet-right moments—each leaving a trace that helps us think more maturely as we continue to create value in our lives.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 11. Prevent deviation before it becomes a problem -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Mature thinking prevents problems from happening</h3>

			<p>Finally, Albert Einstein observed: “A clever person solves a problem. A genius prevents it from happening.” I do not expect us to become geniuses in that sense. What I hope instead is that each person can cultivate a thinking method that is mature enough—slow enough, alert enough, and humble enough—to recognize deviations early before they become problems.</p>

			<p>Preventing errors in thinking is often less noisy than fixing consequences, but it has far more lasting value. When we think more carefully from the start, what we create is not only more effective, but also less likely to become useless—or worse, harmful to others and to ourselves. In that quiet effort, critical thinking is no longer an abstract skill, but becomes the foundation for value to be created in a true and sustainable way.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 12. Suggested resources and learning goals -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Suggested resources and learning directions to strengthen intellect</h3>

			<p>To continue strengthening intellect and make thinking more stable, we can explore further resources and foundational concepts. For instance, Luyện lý trí by Nguyễn Hiến Lê, or Thuật tư tưởng by Thu Giang Nguyễn Duy Cần—works that focus on building reasoning foundations, self-reflection, and disciplined thinking. In addition, learning about cognitive biases helps us recognize the familiar shortcuts the brain often uses, which can easily lead to mistakes in evaluation and decision-making.</p>

			<p>Approaching these materials is not meant to turn people into pure theorists, but to gradually improve the ability to assess, critique, and self-correct one’s own thinking. When we understand inherent weaknesses in thought, we gain the chance to avoid many unnecessary cognitive traps—thereby helping what we create move closer to genuine value rather than being merely the result of habit, emotion, or haste.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 13. Closing -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Conclusion</h3>
			<p>Right thinking is not thinking that never errs, but thinking that knows how to pause, question itself, and learn from what was not yet right.</p>
