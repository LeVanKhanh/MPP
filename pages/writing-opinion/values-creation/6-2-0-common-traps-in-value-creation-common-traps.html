			<p>After discussing the foundational principles of critical thinking—pausing, listening, patience, and willingness to question ourselves—we can easily fall into a sense of reassurance: that if we are careful enough, and think slowly and deeply enough, serious mistakes will have little chance to appear.</p>
			<p>But reality is often more complex than that.</p>
			<p>Distortions in thinking rarely show up as obvious errors or impulsive decisions. Most of them form from thoughts that seem reasonable, conclusions that sound persuasive, and choices that once produced good results in the past. That is why we often do not realize we are drifting—until we have gone quite far.</p>
			<p>The next part of the book is not meant to list mistakes to avoid, nor to declare who is right or wrong. Its goal is to clarify the points where human thinking often slips naturally, even when we have goodwill, experience, and serious intent.</p>
			<p>The traps presented here do not exist in isolation. They often appear in sequence, each trap reinforcing the next, forming a chain of distortions that is hard to notice. Each step in that chain can be justified by reason, and that is precisely what makes it difficult to escape.</p>
			<p>Identifying these traps is not meant to make us doubt every conclusion, nor to force us into chronic skepticism. Instead, it helps us keep a clear distance from our own thinking—enough to pause, look again, and adjust before small deviations accumulate into large consequences.</p>
			<p>You may recognize yourself in a few of these traps. You may also think that some of them do not apply to your situation. Both reactions are natural. What matters is not whether you agree or disagree, but whether you are willing to set aside familiar conclusions temporarily and observe how they were formed.</p>
			<p>This section does not promise to help you avoid every mistake. It only offers a map—not to point to a single correct path, but to help you know where you are when thinking begins to drift away from reality. And sometimes, simply knowing where we are gives us a chance to turn back earlier, before paying too high a price for things that once seemed very reasonable.</p>
