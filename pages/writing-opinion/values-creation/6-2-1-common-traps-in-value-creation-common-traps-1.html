		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When “reasonable” is mistaken for “true”</h3>
			<p>Distortions in thinking rarely begin with superficiality; they often begin with a desire to understand correctly. When people try to arrange reality into coherent arguments, we easily believe that a reasonable form also equals truth. And it is at that seemingly solid foothold that syllogism opens the first trap of thought.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 2. Definition and structure -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">What is a syllogism</h3>
			<p>In classical logic, a syllogism is one of the most basic and common structures of reasoning. It describes how people move from general statements to a specific conclusion through a sequence that appears quite obvious.</p>
			<p>A complete syllogism includes three parts:</p>
			<p><b>Major premise</b> is a broad statement with general scope. This statement is often seen as obviously true, already proven, or tacitly accepted by society.</p>
			<p><b>Minor premise</b> is a narrower statement that points to a specific object, phenomenon, or case that falls within the scope of the major premise.</p>
			<p><b>Conclusion</b> is drawn by linking the two premises: if the major premise is true, and the minor premise truly falls within the scope covered by the major premise, then the conclusion about the minor premise is considered reasonable.</p>
			<p>Formally, a syllogism feels tight and hard to refute. That is why it is often used as a foundational tool in reasoning. However, precisely because it looks so reasonable, a syllogism can easily become the source of subtle errors if one of the premises is misunderstood, applied outside its scope, or accepted too hastily.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 3. Example that is correct within current understanding -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">An example that is correct within current knowledge</h3>
			<p><b>An example of a syllogism that is correct within current understanding.</b></p>
			<p>
				<i>Major premise:</i> All humans must die.<br>
				<i>Minor premise:</i> I am human.<br>
				<i>Conclusion:</i> I will die.
			</p>
			<p>Logically, this is a complete and valid syllogism.<br>
				<b>Major premise</b> needs almost no proof in the current context, because it aligns with all scientific knowledge, history, and lived experience accumulated by humanity so far.<br>
				<b>Minor premise</b> is also uncontested: “I” belong to the category “human,” and I have no reasonable basis to regard myself as anything else (at least for now).<br>
			</p>
			<p>From those two premises, the <b>conclusion</b> is drawn consistently, without internal contradiction. Within current understanding, this syllogism is considered correct both in form and in content.</p>
			<p>However, I deliberately emphasize the phrase “current.” Because the correctness of this syllogism depends entirely on whether the two premises still stand. If in the future it can be shown that:</p>
			<p>
				<i>“I” do not belong to the category “human,” or</i><br>
				<i>there exists a truly immortal human, or</i><br>
				<i>humans can reach immortality through a specific, verifiable mechanism,</i><br>
				then the syllogism above would no longer hold.
			</p>
			<p>This does not make the current argument wrong; it only shows something important: a syllogism does not create eternal truth—it only reflects our level of knowledge at a given time. A syllogism is considered correct when its premises fit the knowledge and reality that are currently accepted. When knowledge changes, the value of the argument must be reconsidered.</p>
			<p>Within my current limits of understanding, this syllogism remains correct. But acknowledging that limit is precisely what keeps thinking from falling into the illusion of possessing absolute truth.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 4. Example wrong in major premise -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Error in the major premise: overgeneralization</h3>
			<p><b>An example of error in the Major premise</b></p>
			<p>
				<i>Major premise:</i> All birds can fly.<br>
				<i>Minor premise:</i> A penguin is a bird.<br>
				<i>Conclusion:</i> A penguin can fly.
			</p>
			<p>Formally, the argument follows the full structure of a syllogism. The minor premise clearly falls within the scope of the major premise, and the conclusion is drawn consistently in logical form.</p>
			<p>However, the mistake here lies not in the structure of the reasoning, but in the major premise. The statement “All birds can fly” is true in most cases, but not for all birds. The major premise overgeneralizes, treating a common feature as a universal one.</p>
			<p>In reality, penguins are not the only exception. Some ground-dwelling birds, such as kiwi, also cannot fly. Although they still have wings, their chest muscles are underdeveloped and insufficient for lift. Rather than adapting to flight, they evolved in another direction: relying more on smell and touch to find food, and being mostly nocturnal.</p>
			<p>The existence of such exceptions shows that the problem is not a lack of logic, but that the major premise simplified a reality more complex than it assumed. When a statement is framed as if there are no exceptions while there actually are, the syllogism—though correct in form—can still lead to a wrong conclusion.</p>
			<p>When a major premise does not fully reflect the scope of what it covers, every conclusion drawn from it—however logical in form—becomes wrong in substance. In this case, the penguin is a clear exception: it is a bird, but it cannot fly.</p>
			<p>This example highlights a common trap in thinking: haste in generalization. When we accept a statement that “seems true” as an absolute truth, the syllogism becomes a tool for reinforcing error rather than bringing us closer to the truth.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 5. Example wrong in minor premise -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Error in the minor premise: accepting a claim as fact</h3>
			<p><b>An everyday example of error in the Minor premise</b></p>
			<p>
				<i>Major premise:</i> Actions done for the collective benefit are right actions.<br>
				<i>Minor premise:</i> This decision was made for the collective benefit.<br>
				<i>Conclusion:</i> Therefore, this decision is right.
			</p>
			<p>At first glance, this argument seems hard to refute. The major premise sounds morally reasonable, and the conclusion is drawn coherently. That is why many people accept the conclusion without feeling the need to stop and examine it.</p>
			<p>However, the issue lies in the minor premise. Declaring a decision as “for the collective benefit” does not mean it truly serves that benefit. The concept of “collective benefit” here may be misunderstood, interpreted one-sidedly, or even used as a moral label to obscure negative consequences for a specific group.</p>
			<p>In this case, the major premise is not necessarily wrong. The mistake appears when the minor premise is accepted without verification: which collective, what benefit, in the short term or the long term, and how the costs are distributed. Without these questions clarified, the minor premise is only a claim, not a verified fact.</p>
			<p>This example shows a familiar trap in social life: when a moral label is attached to an action, it can cause thinking to stop checking. The syllogism is still correct in form, but the conclusion is built on an unproven assumption—and that is why decisions that seem right can lead to mistaken consequences.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 6. Shortened syllogism -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Shortened syllogism: when a premise is hidden</h3>
			<p><b>Shortened syllogism</b></p>
			<p>In practice, people rarely present a full syllogism with all three parts. When a major premise is seen as too familiar, too obvious, or tacitly accepted as “truth,” it is often omitted from reasoning. The result is a shortened syllogism, leaving only a statement that appears to stand on its own as a conclusion.</p>
			<p>In such cases, the task of thinking is no longer to check the conclusion, but to trace back what hidden major premise lies behind it. Only by clarifying that hidden premise can we assess whether the argument is truly solid.</p>
			<p>For example, the cases above could be shortened into seemingly independent statements such as:</p>
			<p>
				<i>I will die.</i><br>
				<i>Penguins can fly.</i><br>
				<i>This decision is right because it serves the collective benefit.</i>
			</p>
			<p>In this shortened form, the reasoning structure is no longer visible. The major premise is concealed, and the conclusion is presented as if it were self-evident, requiring no further explanation. It is precisely that “self-evidence” that makes listeners or readers accept the statement without asking: what was assumed behind it, and is that assumption actually true?</p>
			<p>A shortened syllogism is not an error in itself. It becomes a trap only when we forget that every conclusion stands on one or more premises, and those premises—though hidden—still need careful scrutiny if we want to think with clarity and responsibility.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 7. Practice / recommendation -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Practice: examine “self-evident” statements through the syllogism structure</h3>
			<p><b>The statements below are often accepted as self-evident in daily life. But if we pause for a moment, we can try to examine them through the structure of a syllogism.</b></p>
			<p>
				<i>“We should trust science because science is always right.”</i><br>
				<i>“Everyone deserves a second chance, because everyone can make mistakes.”</i><br>
				<i>“We must protect the environment because it is everyone’s responsibility.”</i><br>
			</p>
			<p>Try to analyze these arguments from the perspective of syllogism. Identify the hidden major and minor premises, then evaluate whether they are truly solid. Through that, you can train critical thinking and avoid falling into subtle traps when creating value.</p>
