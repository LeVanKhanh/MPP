		<!-- 1. Opening: mechanism of distortion -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When repetition creates the illusion of certainty</h3>
			<p>People make mistakes not only when their reasoning lacks logic, but also when they trust too much what has been true before. Something repeated enough in personal or collective experience often creates a sense of certainty, as if it had been fully verified. At that point, what is “often true” silently slides into the place of “always true,” and thinking— which needs vigilance—begins to loosen its guard.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 2. Everyday example -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">A simple example: habits are not absolute commitments</h3>
			<p>Consider an everyday example: “Kyle always arrives at the office at 8 a.m. Therefore, if you want to meet him, come at 8 or later, and you will definitely see him.”</p>
			<p>At first glance, this reasoning seems reasonable. However, the word “always” here does not mean absolutely always; it only reflects Kyle’s daily habit—something often true based on repeated observation in the past.</p>
			<p>Habits, by nature, are stable tendencies, not absolute commitments. It only takes one day of an emergency, an external factor, or simply a change in routine for the premise “Kyle always arrives at 8 a.m.” to no longer hold.</p>
			<p>At that point, the conclusion “you will definitely see him” becomes inaccurate—not because the logic is broken, but because what was often true was unconsciously treated as always true. That silent shift turns a useful experience into a mistaken prediction.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 3. The role of experience -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Experience is data, not truth</h3>
			<p>People often rely on experience to draw conclusions when encountering familiar signals. Experience itself is not wrong; it helps us respond quickly and save mental effort. However, when experience is used as a conclusion in place of verification, it becomes a serious source of risk.</p>
			<p>If experience is treated as a shortcut to form a hypothesis—prompting deeper checking and evaluation—it brings value. But when experience is elevated into a guarantee that makes us ignore the specific conditions of the present, it can lead to significant consequences.</p>
			<p>In short, <b>experience is only data, not truth</b>. It reflects what has happened, but it does not guarantee what will happen. The value of experience lies in providing a base for faster inference and testing, not in replacing examination of a changing reality.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 4. When systems are large: costs increase -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">In large systems, small deviations can become big consequences</h3>
			<p>If this is true in small matters, the costs in large systems are often higher. For example, in the past five years, flood levels have not risen high and the dike system has remained sufficient. From that experience, people easily conclude that this year will be no different.</p>
			<p>But if that familiarity causes us to neglect re-evaluating this year’s weather factors and the actual condition of the dikes, then a single abnormal shift can produce consequences far beyond what past experience ever warned about.</p>
			<p>When an often-true experience is unconsciously treated as always true, thinking begins to lose its vigilance. We no longer ask, “Is this still true in the current context?” and simply repeat familiar conclusions because they once worked. At that point, experience—once a safeguard against error—becomes the very cause of a new error.</p>
			<p>Recognizing the boundary between often true and always true does not mean rejecting experience. It helps us use it for its proper role: a starting point for thinking, not an endpoint. Only with that clear distance can new value be created without being bound by old successes, and thinking avoid freezing inside what has become familiar.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 5. Everyday example: “reading people” books and rigid application -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When “common tendencies” are turned into “certain rules”</h3>
			<p>From my personal experience, some books are very engaging to read, but if applied without caution, they can easily lead to misunderstanding. Some books about body language or “reading people” highlight common tendencies, but they are also easily taken as certain rules.</p>
			<p>What those books present mostly reflects frequent tendencies, not rules that are always true. Humans are diverse, and even a single person can change depending on context, time, and inner state. Therefore, inferring others from a few outward signs easily leads to misunderstanding, or unintentionally makes people feel judged and scrutinized.</p>
			<p>Observing and understanding others is necessary, but perhaps the starting point should be listening and respect, rather than the desire to quickly “read” them. After all, no one wants to be reduced to a few fleeting signals, when each human story always has more layers than what appears at first glance.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 6. Self-check: list of statements -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Self-check: what is “often true,” and what is being treated as “always true”</h3>
			<p>Pause and evaluate the following statements for yourself:</p>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>He is a doctor, so he understands how to care for health properly; we should follow him.</li>
				<li>He is a customer communication expert, so he knows what customers need; trust him and do as he says.</li>
				<li>A plane crash killed all passengers. Kyle was on that flight, so we can conclude that Kyle has died.</li>
				<li>When speaking, his eyes shift constantly; therefore, he is lying.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Read each statement slowly and ask: what in these arguments is often true, and what is being implicitly treated as always true?</p>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Outline summary notes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Repetition can create an illusion of certainty, turning “often true” into “always true.”</li>
				<li>Habits are stable tendencies, not absolute commitments (Kyle example).</li>
				<li>Experience is data, not truth; it needs verification in the current context.</li>
				<li>In large systems, small deviations can lead to large consequences.</li>
				<li>“Common tendencies” can be mistaken for “certain rules.”</li>
				<li>Keep a clear distance: experience is a starting point, not an endpoint.</li>
				<li>Practice distinguishing what is often true from what is treated as always true.</li>

6. THE “OFTEN TRUE” VS “ALWAYS TRUE” TRAP
├─ Central claim
│  └─ “Often true” is mistaken for “always true” when vigilance drops
│
├─ 1) Repetition creates an illusion of certainty
│  └─ Familiar success feels like full verification
│
├─ 2) Everyday example
│  ├─ Kyle often arrives at 8 a.m.
│  └─ Habit ≠ absolute commitment
│
├─ 3) Experience is data
│  ├─ Useful for hypotheses
│  └─ Not a substitute for present verification
│
├─ 4) Large systems, larger costs
│  ├─ Past stability → complacency
│  └─ Abnormal shifts can cause big consequences
│
├─ 5) Tendencies turned into rules
│  ├─ “Reading people” applied rigidly
│  └─ People change with context and time
│
└─ 6) Self-check
   └─ Distinguish often true from always true
