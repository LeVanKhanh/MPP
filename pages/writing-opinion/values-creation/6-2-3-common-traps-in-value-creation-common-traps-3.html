		<!-- 1. Opening: mechanism of the trap -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When repeated coincidence is understood as “cause”</h3>
			<p>After recognizing that what is often true does not mean it is always true, we still face a more subtle trap. When two things appear together frequently, we rush to believe that one causes the other. Repeated coincidence easily creates a sense of certainty, and from that feeling, a causal story is formed—simple, easy to understand, and persuasive.</p>
			<p>In life, this kind of reasoning appears everywhere. People see that successful individuals often share a few habits, then believe those habits created success. People notice a method, a tool, or a choice that often accompanies good results, and treat it as the decisive key. But the fact that two things occur together does not, by itself, prove that one created the other.</p>
			<p>Confusing correlation with causation is not just a pure logical mistake; it is also the source of many misdirected efforts. When we optimize the wrong cause, we may do a lot while creating very little value. Recognizing this trap does not make thinking extremely skeptical; it simply helps us be more cautious before conclusions that sound reasonable—so we do not turn surface observations into the foundation for long-term decisions.</p>

		<!-- 2. Familiar examples: early rising, reading books -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When “surface signals” are mistaken for “decisive factors”</h3>
			<p>In many stories about success, we often encounter familiar patterns. Successful people often wake up early. People with good thinking often read many books. These observations are not wrong; they reflect real correlations in life. The problem begins when we unconsciously treat these co-occurring factors as decisive causes.</p>
			<p>Waking up early may be a necessary condition for success, but it is rarely sufficient. A person can wake up early every day, but without clear goals, disciplined action, or knowing what they are striving for, early rising is just a shift in schedule—it does not create value by itself. In reality, many people wake up early because they already have direction, responsibility, and motivation; those deeper factors are the foundation, while early rising is only the outward expression.</p>
			<p>Similarly, reading books is often linked to good thinking, but reading itself is not enough to guarantee it. Reading can be a necessary condition for broadening perspective and accessing others’ knowledge and experience. But if reading stops at absorbing information without reflection, critique, and connection to real life, it is unlikely to transform into deep thinking. Many people with good thinking read books not because reading created that thinking, but because independent thought and curiosity drive them toward books as a fitting tool.</p>
			<p>Confusion often happens when we reverse the order of causation: we see the result, then trace it back to an easily visible behavior and assign it a decisive role. Waking up early and reading books, in many cases, are only necessary conditions—supporting pieces—rather than sufficient conditions for creating success or good thinking. When we ignore that distinction, we focus on surface habits and forget the core factors lying deeper beneath.</p>
			<p>Recognizing the boundary between necessary and sufficient conditions helps us avoid optimizing the wrong place. Instead of asking “Have I been waking up early enough?” or “Have I read enough books?”, a more valuable question is: what goal do these actions serve, and are they truly connected to my thinking, choices, and real responsibility? Only then can habits that seem right genuinely contribute to value, rather than becoming symbols that merely comfort a sense of progress.</p>

		<!-- 3. Reversal error: A => B does not mean B => A -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Causal reversal error: A ⇒ B does not mean B ⇒ A</h3>
			<p>In study and work, a common reasoning mistake is to assume that if A leads to B, then the appearance of B means A must have occurred. This is a seemingly small logical jump, but it is enough to misdirect many decisions.</p>
			<p>For example, we often observe that many high-performing students attend extra classes. From that link, many people conclude that extra classes are the cause of high performance. But even if tutoring improves results in some cases, reversing the reasoning—if a student performs well, they must have attended extra classes—does not hold. Some students do well thanks to self-study, family environment, suitable methods, or simply curiosity and intrinsic motivation. Extra classes, if present, are only one of many possible paths to that result, not a necessary sign of it.</p>
			<p>A similar mistake appears frequently in workplaces. When we see a high-performing team using tool X, we easily infer that the tool itself produced high productivity. The tool is then replicated, expectations are set, but results disappoint. The reason is this: if a tool can support a team that already has clear thinking, sound processes, and defined responsibility, the reverse is not necessarily true. A team lacking that foundation can use the same tool and still see no improvement, because the tool does not create discipline, coordination, or thinking quality on its own.</p>
			<p>In both cases, the error is not in observing a relationship, but in reversing causation. From the fact that A can contribute to B, we hastily infer that B is evidence of A. When this jump happens, we not only misunderstand reality, but also apply the wrong solutions—investing time, money, or expectations into factors that are not truly decisive.</p>
			<p>Recognizing that A ⇒ B does not mean B ⇒ A keeps us more alert to conclusions that sound reasonable. It reminds us that outcomes are usually the product of many conditions converging, and the most visible factors are not necessarily the core causes. Only by preserving that distinction can we avoid optimizing the wrong place and create value more sustainably.</p>

		<!-- 4. Self-check: list of statements -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Self-check: what is correlation, what is causation</h3>
			<p>Pause and examine the following statements for yourself:</p>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>People in management positions often speak confidently and clearly. Therefore, speaking confidently will help a person become a manager.</li>
				<li>Since joining community Z, I have learned more. Therefore, community Z created my progress.</li>
				<li>Highly disciplined people often keep very detailed work notes. Therefore, keeping full notes will improve work discipline.</li>
				<li>People who make fewer mistakes often spend a lot of time preparing. Therefore, long preparation will help avoid mistakes.</li>
				<li>Organizations with a culture of candid feedback often improve faster. Therefore, candid feedback is the direct cause of improvement.</li>
				<li>Teams with fewer conflicts often work very smoothly at the beginning. Therefore, minimizing disagreement is the key to effective team operation.</li>
				<li>Individuals with strong self-learning ability often use many different resources. Therefore, accessing many resources causes strong self-learning ability.</li>
			</ul>
