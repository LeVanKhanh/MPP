		<!-- 1) Mechanism: belief forms and self-reinforces -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When thinking shifts from “exploring” to “defending”</h3>
			<p>After forming a belief, people rarely return to check whether that belief is truly solid. Instead, we tend to look for signs that confirm we were right. Information that fits is remembered and emphasized; information that conflicts is ignored, downplayed, or explained away. This process is quiet, but enough to turn an initial assumption into “truth” in the mind.</p>
			<p>Confirmation bias does not make us think worse; it makes us think selectively. It does not distort reality at the beginning, but it shapes how we receive reality after a conclusion has already formed. That is why it is especially dangerous: we not only believe the wrong thing, but grow increasingly certain that we are right.</p>
			<p>Confirmation bias does not arise in a state of “knowing nothing.” It begins only after we have a prior belief—whether from personal experience, a past success, advice from an authority, or a conclusion that seems reasonable. At that point, thinking no longer remains in exploration; it shifts into defense.</p>
			<p>Once a belief has formed, thinking no longer receives information neutrally. What fits what we believe is kept and reinforced, while what contradicts it is downplayed, reinterpreted, or unconsciously ignored. We still observe and think, but the direction is already tilted, so each new experience gradually becomes evidence for the old conclusion. This quiet selection mechanism is what makes confirmation bias dangerous: not because we lack data, but because we only see what is safe enough to preserve the initial belief.</p>
			<p>Unlike obvious logical errors, confirmation bias does not make us think poorly; it makes us think selectively. It gives us a sense of consistency, confidence, and control over the world around us. It is precisely that feeling of “being right” that makes it hard—and even uncomfortable—to question ourselves again.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 2) Everyday examples: method and impressions -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Everyday expressions of confirmation bias</h3>
			<p>Sometimes we try a new method and see better results. Next time, we do the same and again see a similar outcome. From there, we start to believe that the method itself is right, and every time things go smoothly, that belief is reinforced. The times it does not work are dismissed as “the circumstances were not favorable.”</p>
			<p>Or we form an initial impression of someone—that they are hard to work with, stubborn, or irresponsible. After that, each small behavior that fits the impression is remembered clearly, while contradictory signals receive little attention. Gradually, the first impression is no longer a hypothesis, but becomes “truth” in how we see that person.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 3) Chain: often true -> causation -> confirmation -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When traps connect into a chain</h3>
			<p>Confirmation bias rarely appears in isolation. It often comes after earlier thinking traps have already taken shape. When something often true is unconsciously treated as always true, or when correlation is mistaken for causation, we lay the foundation for an initial belief. From that point, confirmation bias begins to operate as a protective mechanism: it helps us find signs that reinforce the chosen conclusion while blurring information that could force reconsideration. This sequence is why thinking traps do not exist separately, but link into a chain—from observation, to conclusion, to rigidity. If not recognized in time, that chain can bind thinking to assumptions that once worked but no longer fit a changing reality.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 4) Harm in value creation: persistence in error -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When we are not only wrong, but persist in being wrong</h3>
			<p>In the process of creating value, confirmation bias makes us not only err, but persist in the error. Once we believe a method, choice, or approach is right, we tend to repeat it without questioning, even when context has changed or results no longer match. Early warning signs are minimized, opposing feedback is ignored, and failures are explained away as temporary exceptions. The result is continued investment of time, effort, and resources into factors that no longer truly create value, while opportunities to adjust or pivot pass by. At this point, confirmation bias does not only slow learning; it makes the value created increasingly less sustainable, even if everything still looks reasonable on the surface.</p>
			<p>Learning requires the ability to form hypotheses and be willing to adjust. Confirmation bias, by contrast, turns hypotheses into fixed beliefs and then uses new experience only to reinforce them. At this point, thinking stops developing not because of a lack of information, but because of an inability to accept information that contradicts.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 5) Recognition: keep a clear distance from conclusions -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Keep a clear distance from your own conclusions</h3>
			<p>Recognizing confirmation bias is not meant to make us doubt everything, but to help us keep a clear distance from our own conclusions. When we actively seek counterevidence, listen to opposing views, and accept that we may be wrong, thinking keeps moving. Only in that state can new value be created without getting stuck in old beliefs that once worked.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 6) Self-check: prompting questions -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Self-check: what is being noticed, what is being overlooked</h3>
			<p>Read each statement slowly and ask yourself: what is being noticed, and what might be overlooked?</p>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>People who oppose my view usually do not understand the real context I am facing.</li>
				<li>The data I collected shows that this trend is unfolding exactly as I predicted at the start.</li>
				<li>Opposing opinions may be correct in other cases, but they do not apply to my situation.</li>
			</ul>
