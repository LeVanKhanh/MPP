		<!-- 1. Phenomenon: we learn from what remains visible -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When what we see is not the whole truth</h3>
			<p>In many success stories, we often hear about those who made it, the paths that led to good results, and the choices considered right. We rarely hear about those who tried similar things but went nowhere, or the paths that ended in silence. Not because those stories do not exist, but because they are no longer visible.</p>
			<p>When we observe only what remains after the natural filtering of failure and elimination, we easily believe that the survivors’ traits are the very causes of success. And from that, a new trap forms: we learn from what remains and forget what has disappeared.</p>
			<p>When we look back at wars, we often praise those who survived as the makers of victory. But is history built only by survivors, or also by those who fell and never had the chance to be named?</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 2. Mechanism: the data is biased from the start -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">How survivorship bias operates</h3>
			<p>Survivorship bias does not distort data after we see it; it distorts the very set of data we get to see. When we rely only on “surviving” examples, we unconsciously ignore cases that failed—not because they are less important, but because they are no longer present to be examined.</p>
			<p>Individuals, businesses, or methods that fail gradually disappear from view, while successful cases continue to be told, analyzed, and celebrated. This creates the illusion that we are observing the whole picture, when in reality we are seeing only what is left.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 3. Reasoning error: mistaking survivor traits for causes -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When survivors’ traits are mistaken for causes</h3>
			<p>From the cases that remain, we start to search for common points and treat them as “secrets.” But the fact that a trait appears in successful people does not mean that trait caused success. It may be only a random factor, or a condition unrelated to the final outcome.</p>
			<p>In daily life, we often see only those who achieved their goals, but not the long chain of trial and error, missteps, and failures that were removed from the story. Success, therefore, is not only the result of right actions, but also what remains after many wrong actions have been paid for.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 4. Dangerous combination with confirmation bias -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When survivorship bias combines with confirmation bias</h3>
			<p>After we have already filtered information to confirm a belief (confirmation bias), survivorship bias reinforces the error by limiting what we are allowed to see. Together, these two traps create a powerful loop: we believe what we want to believe, based on examples already filtered in advance.</p>
			<p>Belief is reinforced not because it is more correct, but because counterexamples have been removed from view.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 5. Consequences in value creation -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Learning the wrong lessons from others’ success</h3>
			<p>In creating value, survivorship bias makes us learn the wrong lessons from others’ success. We imitate surface traits, invest in factors that are not truly decisive, and underestimate the role of luck, context, and the failures that were never told.</p>
			<p>As a result, we may follow the “formula” correctly yet still fail to create the value we expect—not because we lack effort, but because we are optimizing based on an incomplete picture.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 6. A more mindful approach -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Ask about what is no longer visible</h3>
			<p>Recognizing survivorship bias is not meant to deny the value of success stories, but to place them in their proper context. When we actively ask <b>“who did not succeed?”</b>, <b>“which paths were eliminated?”</b>, and <b>“what was not told?”</b>, the picture becomes fuller.</p>
			<p>Only then can learning from others’ experience truly help us create value, rather than simply copying what remains after the harsh filtering of reality.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 7. Prompting examples -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Statements that seem self-evident</h3>
			<ul class="outline-list">
				<li>“Successful startups all work very hard” — but thousands of other hardworking startups have disappeared.</li>
				<li>“Wealthy people often accept risk” — but many who accepted risk have nothing left to tell.</li>
				<li>“Great leaders all have long-term vision” — but many with long-term vision failed badly.</li>
			</ul>
