		<!-- 1. Phenomenon: judgment before reason -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When emotion comes before understanding</h3>
			<p>People rarely approach the world with pure reason. Before we can analyze what is happening, we have already felt like or dislike, comfort or unease, right or wrong. When the feeling is strong enough, it is easily treated as an obvious truth. And from that moment, our judgment starts to drift away from the essence of what we think we are seeing.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 2. Illustration: same event, different emotions -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">The same event, two opposite judgments</h3>
			<p>When we encounter an injured rat, many people immediately avoid it, even try to remove it. A cockroach crawling toward our food often triggers only discomfort or disgust. But if in front of us is a small injured bird, or an animal we consider “pitiful,” the response is completely different: we tend to pause, care, even want to protect it.</p>
			<p>What is notable is not the actions of those creatures, but the emotions we attach to them. Both are injured, both are seeking food, but by changing the image and association, our judgment flips.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 3. Mechanism: emotion replaces observation -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When interpretation replaces reality</h3>
			<p>What we react to is not the event itself, but the story we tell ourselves about it. The same action, when placed in different interpretive frames, produces different emotions. And when interpretation replaces observation, judgment begins to drift away from reality.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 4. Trap: the certainty of feeling -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">The dangerous illusion of “feeling right”</h3>
			<p>Emotion not only colors experience; it quietly steers decisions. When we let emotion take the central seat without noticing it, we easily evaluate events not by their essence, but by the immediate feeling they evoke in us.</p>
			<p>The stronger the emotion, the less we doubt ourselves. It creates a dangerous illusion: the feeling of certainty. Once we “feel right,” we often no longer see the need to double-check, listen further, or delay a decision.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 5. Consequence in value creation -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">When decisions feel right but head in the wrong direction</h3>
			<p>In creating value, judgments led by emotion often feel “right” but do not lead to sustainable results. Such decisions may bring immediate satisfaction, but over time they erode the ability to learn and adjust—the two core elements of sustainable value creation.</p>
		</div>

		<!-- 6. A mindful pause -->
		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Keeping emotion in its proper place</h3>
			<p>I suddenly recall a saying: <i>“Flowers do not enchant people; people enchant themselves.”</i> Is the mind truly led by the outside world, or are our inner emotions the quiet force that shapes us? Things come and go; the difference between immersion and clarity lies in how we receive them.</p>
			<p>Emotion makes life rich and deep. But only when we use it with awareness can it enrich experience, rather than quietly guide and dominate our judgment.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Emotions often come before reason and are treated as truth.</li>
				<li>The same event can trigger opposite judgments based on emotion.</li>
				<li>We react to interpretations, not pure events.</li>
				<li>“Feeling right” creates an illusion of certainty and reduces rechecking.</li>
				<li>Emotion-led decisions may feel right but be unsustainable.</li>
				<li>Keep emotion in its proper place to enrich, not dominate, judgment.</li>
