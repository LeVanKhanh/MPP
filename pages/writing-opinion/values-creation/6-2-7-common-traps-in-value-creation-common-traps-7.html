		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Anchoring Bias</h3>
			<p>
				Anchoring bias occurs when we rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive,
				and unconsciously use it as a reference point for later judgments.
				Even when the initial information is no longer relevant,
				it continues to influence how we think and decide.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Framing Effect</h3>
			<p>
				The framing effect appears when the way a problem is presented
				changes our perception of that very problem.
				The same information, framed positively or negatively,
				can lead us to completely different decisions.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Bandwagon Effect</h3>
			<p>
				The bandwagon effect is the tendency to believe a choice is right
				simply because many others also believe it or follow it.
				In this context, the sense of safety in “going with the crowd”
				can override independent and rational evaluation.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Hindsight Bias</h3>
			<p>
				Hindsight bias makes us believe that outcomes that already happened
				were “something we should have foreseen.”
				After knowing the result, we often overestimate our past ability to predict,
				and draw unfair conclusions from it.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Optimism Bias</h3>
			<p>
				Optimism bias is the tendency to underestimate risks
				and overestimate the likelihood of positive outcomes for ourselves.
				This makes us more likely to ignore unfavorable scenarios
				and prepare inadequately for bad situations.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Status Quo Bias</h3>
			<p>
				Status quo bias makes us tend to keep things as they are,
				even when other options might be better.
				Familiarity often creates a sense of safety,
				causing us to delay or avoid change.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Overconfidence Bias</h3>
			<p>
				Overconfidence bias occurs when we overestimate our knowledge,
				skills, or ability to control situations.
				This can lead to hasty decisions
				and underestimating uncertainty.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Halo Effect</h3>
			<p>
				The halo effect makes us generalize from one prominent trait
				to judge an entire person, idea, or product.
				A positive first impression can obscure
				other aspects that have not been verified.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div class="sub-section">
			<h3 class="sub-point-1">Selective Perception</h3>
			<p>
				Selective perception is the tendency to focus only on information
				that fits existing beliefs, while ignoring or downplaying
				conflicting data.
				This gradually narrows our perspective
				without us noticing.
			</p>
		</div>
