            <p>In this section, I do not dive into listing specific values that were “trapped” or the mistaken consequences they produced. What matters more is how human thinking is easily influenced, and how subtle distortions in perception lead us to decisions that seem reasonable but lack sound judgment. Only by understanding how thinking goes off track can we find ways to build a sufficiently solid awareness—so that creating value is guided not just by goodwill, but also by clarity and true understanding.</p>
            <p>Albert Einstein once said, “I think and think for months and years. Ninety-nine times, the conclusion is wrong. The hundredth time I am right.” This shows that even a mind considered brilliant is not immune to mistakes in reasoning. The difference does not lie in Einstein making fewer mistakes, but in his willingness to go through errors, notice them, and patiently adjust his thinking. Perhaps the true foundation of a great mind is caution in reasoning, seriousness about flaws in logic, and the ability to learn from wrong conclusions—rather than instantaneous correctness.</p>
            <p>Humans tend to choose convenience over correctness, favor what is easily accessible over what requires careful consideration. We often trust what is familiar and close to our experience, rather than patiently seeking what approaches the truth. Many decisions rest on what is “already known,” on immediate intuition, or on subjective feeling instead of a thorough and deliberate evaluation. These natural tendencies, when unnoticed, easily lead us into errors of perception and choice.</p>
            <p>I am not exempt from those tendencies. I am quite aware of how the human brain operates—and I know that I am not immune to those biases. While writing, I try to keep what is presented as neutral as possible, as reliable as I can make it. Yet absolute neutrality is likely an ideal. What I can do—and choose to do—is to be cautious with my own thinking, to keep questioning my conclusions, and to accept that even after trying my best, subtle biases may still appear somewhere in each argument.</p>
            <p>So what should we do to reduce these distortions?</p>
            <p>The first—and most important—step is to learn to pause. Not to stop acting, but to stop reacting. Take a beat to self-question before deciding, especially when decisions spring from strong emotion, premature certainty, or an “obvious” feeling that is hard to explain. In that moment of pausing, thought has a chance to escape its usual inertia.</p>
            <p>This spirit has been noted since early in the history of ideas. Socrates warned that rushed thinking leads people to wrong conclusions. Aristotle held that a thoughtful person does not readily accept anything at first exposure. Centuries later, Albert Einstein modestly admitted, “It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.”</p>
            <p>Three different expressions, pointing to the same thing: the quality of thought is not in speed, but in the maturity of deliberation. Pausing does not make us less decisive; it lets decisions be made on steadier awareness. When we give ourselves time to think, to question, to check initial assumptions, we create distance from the familiar traps of thought—traps that make us believe we have understood enough when we have only understood a part.</p>
            <p>Pausing, therefore, is not a sign of hesitation, but of responsibility for what we are about to create.</p>
            <p>Next, we need to learn to listen. Listening is not merely hearing, nor simply waiting for our turn to respond. In a deeper sense, listening is the effort to take in fully what someone is saying: what issue they see, where their real concern lies, and how what they want to convey may differ from how we are currently understanding it.</p>
            <p>Stephen Covey once said, “Listening is the first step of critical thinking.” This points to an important link: without genuine listening, evaluation becomes hurried judgment. Only when we truly grasp the issue—what is being said, not what we imagine is being said—do we have a basis to weigh, critique, and decide more wisely.</p>
            <p>Listening, then, is not concession or passivity; it is an active exercise of intellect. It is how we set aside the self for a moment to open space for more accurate understanding—a prerequisite if we want to avoid thought traps and create true value.</p>
            <p>Even with matters where intuition tells us “something is off” right away, what is needed is to delay judgment. Instead of rushing to label right–wrong, we can choose to note it, keep it under observation, and spend time examining it more carefully. Initial feeling can be useful, but if used as a final verdict it easily becomes a shortcut of thinking—fast, convenient, but lacking depth.</p>
            <p>This caution is not to deny intuition, but to put it in its proper place: as a signal to verify, not a finished judgment. Only when we allow ourselves enough time to view an issue from multiple angles do we have a chance to distinguish between subjective feeling and the essence of the matter.</p>
            <p>Leonardo da Vinci said, “Patience serves as a protection against wrongs as clothes do against cold.” In thinking, clarity seldom appears in haste. It usually forms from the ability to delay judgment, accept some uncertainty for a time, and stay with the problem until necessary connections emerge.</p>
            <p>Patience, then, is not slowness, but respect for reality’s complexity—a key condition for thought to avoid oversimplified traps and hasty conclusions.</p>
            <p>After pausing, listening, and deferring judgment, the next step is to gather information and critically examine whether the issue is truly reasonable. Not to hunt for evidence that reinforces what we already believe, but to widen the cognitive picture—broad enough to reveal points we had not considered.</p>
            <p>The most important tool here is not the answer, but the question. Galileo Galilei stressed, “The real essence is in how well we pose questions.” A well-posed question can shake assumptions that seemed obvious, forcing thought off its habitual track. In the same spirit, Albert Einstein noted, “Critical thinking is the ability to challenge assumptions without fear.” Critique, then, is not about negating others, but daring to re-examine the foundation of our own thinking.</p>
            <p>Yet questioning and critique are effective only when we are aware of the biases steering thought. These biases rarely appear as rigid beliefs; they hide in thought habits, personal experience, or in what “everyone knows.” Henry Ford said, “Creativity never happens in a mind full of prejudice.” When thinking is locked by preset assumptions, new information is taken selectively, and critique quickly becomes perfunctory.</p>
            <p>Therefore, alongside removing prejudice, we should actively seek difference—perspectives that do not align with how we are thinking. Steve Jobs encouraged, “Think different if you want different results.” Difference here is not for showing individuality, but to open new cognitive possibilities—possibilities that appear only when we step out of the comfort zone of familiar thought.</p>
            <p>Gathering information, asking questions, challenging assumptions, and seeking difference do not guarantee we will always conclude correctly. But they greatly reduce the chance of being confidently wrong. In the journey of creating value, avoiding major errors is itself an important kind of value.</p>
            <p>And even after pausing, listening, being patient, gathering information, and critiquing carefully, we can still reason wrongly. That is not only possible; it is almost unavoidable. Error, in this case, is not a sign of incompetence, but a natural result of daring to think and conclude in a world more complex than any individual can grasp.</p>
            <p>What matters is not avoiding every mistake, but how we face mistakes once they appear. When an argument is shown to be incorrect, we can choose denial, justification, or avoidance. Or we can choose the harder way: accept it, review the thinking that led there, and learn from where reasoning went astray.</p>
            <p>Thomas Edison said, “Every failure is a lesson in critical thinking.” In that spirit, mistakes are not something to hide or be ashamed of, but valuable data—signals that help us understand our cognitive limits. By seriously learning from those mistakes, thought gets refined, becomes more flexible, and less prone to familiar traps next time.</p>
            <p>Progress in thinking, then, is not a path from right to right, but a journey through many not-yet-right steps—each leaving a trace that helps us think more carefully as we continue creating value in our lives.</p>
            <p>Einstein also remarked, “An intelligent person solves a problem. A genius prevents it.” I do not expect us to become geniuses in that sense. My hope is that each person can train a sufficiently mature method of thinking—slow enough, clear enough, and humble enough—to spot distortions before they become problems.</p>
            <p>Preventing thinking errors is usually quieter than fixing consequences, but it has far greater long-term value. When we think carefully from the start, what we create is not only more effective but less likely to become useless—or worse, harmful to others and to ourselves. In that quiet effort, critical thinking stops being an abstract skill and becomes the foundation for value to be formed rightly and sustainably.</p>
            <p>To keep strengthening the mind and making thought steadier, we can dig deeper into some foundational works and concepts. For example, <em>Luyen Ly Tri</em> by Nguyễn Hiến Lê or <em>Thuat Tu Tuong</em> by Thu Giang Nguyễn Duy Cần—books focused on building reasoning foundations, self-reflection, and discipline in thought. Learning about cognitive biases also helps us recognize familiar shortcuts the brain uses that often lead to poor judgments and decisions.</p>
            <p>The point of approaching these materials is not to turn people into pure theorists, but to gradually improve the ability to reason, critique, and self-correct how we think. By understanding more of the inherent weaknesses of thought, we have a chance to avoid many unnecessary cognitive traps—helping what we create come closer to true value rather than being just the product of habit, feeling, or haste.</p>
            <p>Thinking rightly does not mean never being wrong; it means knowing how to pause, to doubt oneself, and to learn from the times we were not right.</p>
