			<h2 class="main-point">Introduction</h2>
			<p class="intro-text">Before talking about creating value in practice, one thing needs to be made clear: value does not appear by chance. It is the result of abilities formed and trained over a long period. This section focuses on five core skills that I believe are the foundation for every journey of value creation.</p>
			<div class="sub-section">
				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Skill 1 - The Ability to Learn and Self-Learn</h3>
				<p>To create value, people must first build within themselves the ability to create value. And among all such abilities, the most important foundation is the ability to learn and to self-learn.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-section">
				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Skill 2 - Perseverance</h3>
				<p>Value is rarely created through leaps. Most value is formed through the slow progress of very small things, repeated over a long time. Therefore, perseverance is not only a virtue, but a foundational skill for creating sustainable value.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-section">
				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Skill 3 - Self-Motivation</h3>
				<p>“Give me a place to stand, and I will move the Earth,” Archimedes once said, referring to the principle of leverage in the physical world. But in inner life, what is that fulcrum? What allows a person to stand firm and keep moving when circumstances become unfavorable and external support disappears?</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-section">
				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Skill 4 - Habit Formation</h3>
				<p>In nature, many processes unfold without consciousness or effort. Water flows from high to low by inertia, the Earth revolves around the Sun in its cycle, and clouds accumulate enough moisture to inevitably become rain. The natural world runs by stable laws, like automatic machines that generate phenomena without continuous intervention.</p>
				<p>This raises a question: can the value humans want to create be formed by a similar mechanism? In essence, the answer is no. Humans are not purely automatic systems, and value cannot arise without awareness and choice. However, people can still create a state close to that “automatic” condition. That state is called habit.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-section">
				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Skill 5 - Knowing</h3>
				<p>From childhood, I heard a saying: “The clever die, the foolish die, but the knowing live.” At the time, I did not fully grasp its meaning. Only after enough collisions in life did I gradually realize that it does not speak of intelligence or stupidity in the usual sense, but of a deeper layer of awareness — the ability to “know.”</p>
			</div>
			<div class="sub-section">
				<h3 class="sub-point-1">Summary - Five Skills, One Path</h3>
				<p>The five skills presented in this section do not exist as separate fragments, nor are they arranged by higher or lower importance. They form a linked chain of abilities, in which each skill plays a distinct role, but only fully shows its meaning when placed in relation to the others.</p>
				<p>The ability to learn and self-learn opens cognitive capacity, helping people continuously expand their understanding and adjust their view of the world. But understanding, if not sustained long enough, is quickly forgotten. Therefore, perseverance becomes the condition that keeps a person on the chosen path, beyond the slow phase where results are not visible.</p>
				<p>However, perseverance cannot exist without motivation. When external recognition fades and emotions no longer support us, the ability to self-motivate allows people to keep moving from inner strength rather than dependence on circumstance. Motivation keeps the will from collapsing, but if all effort must rely solely on willpower, people will eventually be depleted.</p>
				<p>Here, habit plays a transforming role. When right actions are organized into habit, value no longer depends on momentary inspiration or determination, but becomes a stable flow in life. Habits help people save energy, reduce inner friction, and sustain value-creating action over time.</p>
				<p>Yet habit, though necessary, is still not enough. An action that was once right can become wrong when context changes. A path that once fit can become a burden if followed unconsciously. Therefore, the skill of “knowing” appears as the final regulating layer: knowing how to observe the context, adjust behavior, and know enough not to wear oneself down in the process of creating value.</p>
				<p>Seen as a whole, these five skills are not meant to help people move faster or achieve more in a short time. They are built to help people move in the right direction, long enough, without losing themselves along the way. Each skill answers a different problem, but all point toward one common goal: creating value sustainably while preserving humanity and a basic ethical foundation.</p>
				<p>Finally, it should be emphasized: none of these skills is a mandatory formula. They are not offered as demands, but as invitations. Each person will pass through these five skills at different speeds and at different times in life. What matters is not rigidly following every step, but recognizing what is missing and adjusting with awareness.</p>
				<p>If these five skills can serve as a map, it is not meant to replace the path you must walk yourself. It only helps you orient when you need to begin, and stay alert enough to stop or turn when circumstances change. The journey of creating value—like every meaningful journey in life—ultimately still belongs to you.</p>
