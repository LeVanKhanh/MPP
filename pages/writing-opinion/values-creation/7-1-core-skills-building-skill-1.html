        <!-- 1. Foundational role of learning -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Learning as the foundational condition for creating value</h3>
            <p>To create value, people must first build within themselves the ability to create value. And among all such abilities, the most important foundation is the ability to learn and self-learn.</p>
            <p>In the section “Creating Value Through Actions,” I emphasized that knowledge, by itself, is not enough to create value. Value appears only when knowledge is transformed into action. However, this does not reduce the role of learning. On the contrary, knowledge is a necessary and irreplaceable condition. Without knowledge, action becomes blind; without learning, effort easily falls into repetition and error.</p>

        <!-- 2. Learning as a process of expanding capacity -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Learning is not limited to school</h3>
            <p>Ability and intelligence are not fixed innate traits, but are formed and expanded through continuous learning. Learning is not confined to classrooms or degrees. School is only one path; society, work, life collisions, and even personal failures can all become teachers if we know how to observe and reflect.</p>
            <p>What matters is not where we learn, but whether we truly learn. Accumulating knowledge does not happen in special moments, but through a quiet process—day by day, hour by hour. That persistence, over time, builds capability, and from capability, value can be created.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. Learning as self-restructuring -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Learning as a process of self-restructuring</h3>
            <p>Learning is not merely absorbing new information; it is a process of restructuring ourselves. Each time we learn something new, the brain must leave familiar patterns to form new connections. That is why learning often comes with discomfort—and also why many people stop too early.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. Three zones of learning experience -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Three experience zones in the learning process</h3>
            <p>In psychology, the learning process is often described through three zones of experience: <b>the Comfort Zone, the Stretch Zone, and the Panic Zone.</b></p>
            <p><b>The Comfort Zone</b> is where we feel safe and familiar. There we operate using existing skills and habits. This zone brings ease, but if we stay too long, it also means stagnation. No new capability is created in the comfort zone.</p>
            <p><b>The Stretch Zone</b> is the transition zone—where challenge is just enough to require effort, but not so much that it overwhelms our capacity. This is where the brain works most effectively. Mild tension or confusion is not a sign of failure, but often a sign of growth.</p>
            <p><b>The Panic Zone</b> appears when pressure exceeds our ability to adapt. At that point, the brain switches to survival mode, learning becomes ineffective, and negative imprints can be left behind.</p>
            <p>The issue is not avoiding challenge, but adjusting challenge so we can stay in the Stretch Zone long enough. Sustainable self-learning is not about constantly pushing beyond limits, but expanding them little by little.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 5. The “destiny loop” in learning -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">The destiny loop of learning and development</h3>
            <p>The ability to learn is also influenced by a deeper structure—what might be called the <b>“destiny loop.”</b> This loop begins with <b>worldview</b>, shapes <b>identity</b>, leads to <b>values and beliefs</b>, influences <b>thinking</b>, creates <b>thoughts</b>, leads to <b>behavior</b>, forms <b>habits</b>, gradually becomes <b>character</b>, and finally what we call <b>destiny</b>.</p>
            <p>Seen closely, destiny is not mysterious, but the result that can be traced back to very small choices in how we learn, think, and act each day. Understanding this loop helps us realize that improving learning ability is sometimes not about methods, but about reexamining beliefs and the way we see ourselves.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 6. Reflection: the bridge between action and wisdom -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Reflection - the condition for learning to become wisdom</h3>
            <p>A key factor in learning is <b>reflection</b>. Reflection is not retelling experience, but returning to experience to consider: what really happened, why we reacted that way, and whether we understood correctly or merely followed habit.</p>
            <p>Reflection helps raw experience transform into knowledge. Without reflection, experience simply passes by; with reflection, experience becomes an internal asset.</p>
            <p>Action creates living data; reflection organizes and draws patterns from that data. Because of this, the learner not only does more, but understands more deeply.</p>
            <p>Learning without reflection easily becomes mechanical repetition; reflection without action becomes abstract speculation. Only when action and reflection go together can knowledge be formed, capability expanded, and value created sustainably.</p>
