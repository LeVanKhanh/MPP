        <!-- 1. Perseverance as a foundational condition of value -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Perseverance as the condition for value to form</h3>
            <p>Value is rarely created through leaps. Most value forms through the slow progress of very small things, repeated over a long time. Therefore, perseverance is not only a virtue, but a foundational skill for creating sustainable value.</p>
            <p>Not every persistent effort creates value, but no value is created without perseverance. Perseverance is the quiet bridge between potential and results, between initial intention and final value.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 2. Perseverance is not exhaustion -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Perseverance does not mean exhaustion</h3>
            <p>Perseverance does not mean doing more or pushing to exhaustion. It is the ability to stay with a path long enough, to keep moving even when results do not appear immediately. In a world used to speed and instant outcomes, perseverance becomes a rare advantage for those who understand that growth takes time.</p>
            <p>Value accumulates only when we focus on the field we have chosen. Distraction drains energy; perseverance concentrates energy and turns it into depth. Each small action, if done consistently, stops being small when viewed across a long enough timeline.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. Passion and its limits -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">The limits of passion</h3>
            <p>Passion is often praised as a great human energy. It helps us start faster, work more eagerly, and devote time without feeling tired. But passion by itself is not enough to carry us through prolonged difficult periods.</p>
            <p>Passion is doing what we like. Perseverance is the ability to keep doing what is necessary, even when it does not bring immediate positive emotion. Many important turning points in life are not created by moments of excitement, but by endurance with quiet, monotonous tasks that sometimes meet inner resistance.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. Perseverance in quiet actions -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Perseverance in actions no one praises</h3>
            <p>To clarify this difference, I borrow an image from the film <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>. Andy Dufresne’s perseverance is not shown through momentary inspiration, but through repeated, quiet, prolonged actions.</p>
            <p>Writing letters for books to build a prison library is a slow process that easily discourages. Yet that persistence is what creates real change. The escape—the greatest test of perseverance—is not romantic, but dirty, harsh, and lonely. Yet it is what had to be done to reach freedom.</p>
            <p>This image reminds us: passion may help us start, but perseverance is what carries us through the most uncomfortable parts of the journey. And it is precisely on those stretches that lasting value is formed.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 5. Perseverance tied to ideals -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Perseverance beyond personal emotion</h3>
            <p>In human history, many struggles for independence and freedom lasted for decades, even beyond a single lifetime. Some generations began the journey without living to see its end.</p>
            <p>Those paths were rarely driven by passion in the usual sense. Struggle is tied to loss, sacrifice, and uncertainty. What kept people going was not excitement, but an ideal—a value seen as necessary and beyond personal interest.</p>
            <p>Such actions show that there are things people do not because they want to, but because they believe they must. And the ability to persevere with what is “necessary,” even when it is not pleasant, is the deepest foundation of any value with lasting meaning.</p>

                <li>No sustainable value exists without perseverance.</li>
