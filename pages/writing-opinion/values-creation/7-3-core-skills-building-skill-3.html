        <!-- 1. Inner anchor -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">An inner anchor in human life</h3>
            <p>“Give me a place to stand, and I will move the Earth,” Archimedes once said when speaking of leverage in the physical world. But in inner life, what is that fulcrum? What allows a person to stand firm, even keep moving, when circumstances turn unfavorable and external support gradually disappears?</p>
            <p>As I noted in “Sustainable and Ethical Value Creation,” we cannot change other people’s thinking, nor should we expect that others will always understand, always help, or always stand by us. External support may exist, and sometimes is essential, but it is never the decisive factor.</p>
            <p>If we do not have a strong enough inner anchor, then no matter how much support we receive, the results we achieve will rarely last. In the journey of creating value, each person is ultimately the most important anchor—and self-motivation is the clearest expression of that anchor.</p>

        <!-- 2. Limits of external recognition -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">When recognition is no longer a support</h3>
            <p>Today, with the power of media and crowd reactions, celebrating or condemning an individual can happen in a very short time. A small mistake can be amplified, labeled, and pushed to extremes, while the chance to correct it is barely considered.</p>
            <p>When a person’s value is placed entirely in external reactions, all previous effort becomes fragile. If that person lacks the ability to stand and keep walking when support disappears, what they have built can collapse—not because it is worthless, but because there is not enough inner strength to preserve and develop it.</p>
            <p>In that context, the skill of self-motivation becomes essential. No one can walk the long axis of value on our behalf. Support can help us start, but only we can carry ourselves through the hardest stretches.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. Motivation and failure -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Motivation in phases when no one pushes us</h3>
            <p>Failure is unavoidable. On a long road, there will be times when we doubt ourselves, feel tired, and become discouraged. That is not a sign of weakness, but a natural part of growth.</p>
            <p>The issue is not whether we fail, but how we respond after failure. In those moments, the ability to self-motivate becomes decisive: lifting ourselves when no one else pushes, reminding ourselves why we started, and staying clear enough to continue even when emotion no longer supports us.</p>
            <p>We can fail. We can stop to rest. But we cannot quit.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. Motivation and perseverance -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Motivation as the foundation of perseverance</h3>
            <p>In the journey of creating value, motivation is the deep foundation of perseverance. Perseverance answers how we keep going, but motivation answers harder questions: why we started, and why we must continue when the road grows heavy.</p>
            <p>Without deep enough motivation, perseverance eventually becomes mechanical strain and exhaustion. Self-motivation is not about forcing inspiration every day, but about sustaining meaning after inspiration is gone.</p>
            <p>It is a quiet commitment to oneself: to continue not because of recognition, but because we understand why this path is worth seeing through.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 5. Positive thinking (rightly understood) -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Positive thinking as a condition for preserving motivation</h3>
            <p>One of the important foundations that helps people self-motivate is positive thinking, when understood correctly. Positive thinking is not blind optimism, but the ability to keep the inner world stable enough to continue acting in unfavorable circumstances.</p>
            <p>When thinking stays positive, we preserve mental energy, keep a clear mind, and still see the possibility of action. That stability helps us think more clearly, decide more accurately, and not be swept away by immediate emotion.</p>
            <p>By contrast, negative thinking quietly erodes a person. It creates no value, only drains energy, misdirects effort, and in many cases harms the person who carries it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, keeping a positive mindset is not about escaping reality, but about staying clear and steady enough to face reality. It is a necessary condition for motivation not to run dry, perseverance not to be eroded, and value to be formed in a healthy and sustainable way.</p>
