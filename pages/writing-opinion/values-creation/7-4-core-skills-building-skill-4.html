        <!-- 1. Habit as a near-automatic mechanism -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Habit as a near-automatic mechanism in human life</h3>
            <p>In nature, many processes unfold without conscious effort. Water flows from high to low by inertia, the Earth rotates around the Sun in its cycle, and clouds accumulate enough moisture to inevitably become rain. The natural world runs by stable laws, like automatic machines that generate phenomena without continuous intervention.</p>
            <p>This raises a question: can the value humans want to create be formed by a similar mechanism? In essence, the answer is no. Humans are not purely automatic systems, and value cannot arise without awareness and choice. However, people can still create a state close to that “automatic” mode. That state is called habit.</p>
            <p>Habits allow action to occur steadily without constantly mobilizing willpower or consuming too much mental energy. When a value-creating action is organized into habit, it no longer depends on momentary inspiration or determination, but becomes a natural flow in daily life.</p>

        <!-- 2. Habit formation mechanism -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">How habits form and their role</h3>
            <p>In <i>The Power of Habit</i>, Charles Duhigg points out that habits are not just repeated actions, but near-automatic response loops triggered by familiar cues in the environment. When an action is repeated long enough in the same context, the brain stores it as a reflex, enabling people to act without much deliberation.</p>
            <p>In this chapter, the habits discussed are good habits—habits that help people sustain and create value. When a person forms more good habits, the space for bad habits naturally shrinks. Not because they disappear completely, but because they no longer have enough room to dominate.</p>

        <!-- 3. Limits and necessary imperfection -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">The limits of habit and the need for imperfection</h3>
            <p>Humans are not perfect beings. In daily life, bad habits, whether few or many, still tend to creep in and persist. The issue is not trying to eliminate them absolutely, but how much we accept, and whether they erode the core values being built.</p>
            <p>Even to a certain extent, these imperfect habits can contribute to a life that is richer and less monotonous. They remind us that life is not a system optimized into coldness, but a living journey where discipline and freedom must coexist.</p>

        <!-- 4. Foundational habit ecosystem -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Foundational habits that accumulate value</h3>

            <p><b>Act in the present moment.</b><br>
            The past is closed, the future has not arrived. The present moment is the only thing we truly possess. Value is not created in memory or expectation, but in action happening now.</p>

            <p><b>Sleep enough and wake early.</b><br>
            Body and brain function effectively only when rested. Sleep restores physical strength and rebuilds clarity—the foundation for every right decision.</p>

            <p><b>Nurture curiosity and a spirit of exploration.</b><br>
            Curiosity pushes people beyond the familiar, to ask questions and seek the nature of things—thereby expanding knowledge and mind.</p>

            <p><b>Practice critical thinking.</b><br>
            Critique is not about negation, but about verification and deeper understanding, helping avoid passive acceptance of knowledge.</p>

            <p><b>Keep spaces of stillness in the mind.</b><br>
            Stillness creates room for the brain to reorganize experience, release tension, and see what is easily missed in busyness.</p>

            <p><b>Maintain a habit of movement.</b><br>
            Movement nourishes life energy. A healthy body is the foundation for pursuing long-term values.</p>

            <p><b>Eat in a scientific and mindful way.</b><br>
            How we eat reflects the respect we give ourselves. What we put into the body, without understanding, can quietly harm it.</p>

        <!-- 5. Habits as living tools -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Habits as living tools</h3>
            <p>The habits above do not exist separately; they interweave and support one another. A healthy body enables clear thinking; a quiet mind gives action direction; and timely action turns understanding into real value.</p>
            <p>This list is only suggestive, reflecting personal experience and observation. It is not a mandatory template for everyone.</p>
            <p>Each person has different goals, starting points, and life contexts. A good habit for one person may not fit another. The point is not to copy, but to understand which habits serve the path you are on.</p>
            <p>Life does not stand still. When circumstances and goals change, habits that were once useful also need adjustment. Habits are not immutable principles, but living tools—meant to be reviewed and adapted across different stages of life.</p>
