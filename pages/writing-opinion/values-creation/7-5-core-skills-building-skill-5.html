        <!-- 1. Limits of habit -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">The limits of habit and the need for a higher layer of awareness</h3>
            <p>The skill of habit formation helps people turn right actions into a stable flow of life. When an action is repeated long enough, it no longer requires constant willpower, and value begins to be created steadily.</p>
            <p>However, at this very strength, an important limit appears: an action that is right in one context can become wrong in another. A habit that created value yesterday can become a constraint if the surrounding world has changed.</p>
            <p>Therefore, habit—though necessary—is still not enough. Without a higher capacity to observe and adjust, habit can easily become blind inertia.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 2. The nature of “knowing” -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">“Knowing” as a guiding capacity for action</h3>
            <p>Humans need another layer of awareness to guide action—that is “knowing.” Knowing how to observe context, how to adjust behavior, and knowing when to continue and when to stop.</p>
            <p>If habit answers the question <b>“how do we act consistently”</b>, then “knowing” answers a harder question: <b>“should we continue acting that way?”</b></p>
            <p>From here, we move to the fifth skill—“Knowing”: the foundation that helps people not only create value, but also survive and adapt long enough for that value to continue forming.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. Clever, foolish, and living -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Between clever and foolish: knowing to live</h3>
            <p>From childhood, I heard the saying: <i>“The clever die, the foolish die, but the knowing live.”</i> Only after enough collisions in life did I gradually realize that it does not speak of intelligence or stupidity in the usual sense, but of a deeper layer of awareness—“knowing.”</p>
            <p>The earlier skills help people create value. But the skill of “knowing” serves a different role: it helps us survive, so we still have the chance to create new values.</p>
            <p>“Knowing” here does not mean cunning or calculation. It is the ability to distinguish, at the right time, between cleverness and foolishness: knowing when to be sharp, and knowing when to step back, keep things simple, even accept a loss.</p>
            <p>A truly wise person is not someone who always appears clever, but someone who chooses responses appropriate to context. There are times when obvious cleverness becomes dangerous; and there are times when seeming foolish is the safest cover.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. Knowing from experience -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">“Knowing” as a lived form of wisdom</h3>
            <p>The boundary between cleverness and foolishness cannot be memorized from books, nor framed by a fixed formula. This “knowing” can only be formed through lived experience—through mistakes, costs, and personal reflection.</p>
            <p>It is the result of observing people, understanding context, and most importantly, understanding oneself. Therefore, “knowing” is not a skill that can be taught quickly, but a form of wisdom refined gradually over years.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 5. Knowing enough -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Knowing enough so we do not wear ourselves down</h3>
            <p>Alongside knowing how to act and adapt, people need another important capacity: <b>knowing enough</b>. Knowing context helps us survive the outside world; knowing enough keeps us from exhausting ourselves within.</p>
            <p>Knowing enough is not giving up or settling too early, but the ability to stop at the right time to recognize what we have already achieved. We set goals and strive fully toward them—that, in essence, is enough.</p>
            <p>If we do not know enough with our own efforts, we easily fall into prolonged fatigue, where effort brings no joy and only pressure remains. Then motivation dries up and the road ahead becomes heavier than the challenges themselves.</p>
            <p>Knowing enough does not mean stopping. On the contrary, it is the rest needed to go farther. When we allow ourselves to acknowledge what we have achieved, we gain the clarity to set new goals—not from lack, but from self-understanding.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 6. Conclusion -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">“Knowing” as the capacity that preserves choice</h3>
            <p>The skill of “Knowing” does not help us move faster, but helps us move in the right direction and long enough. Knowing the context keeps us from being swept away by the outside world; knowing enough keeps us from wearing ourselves down within.</p>
            <p>Between acting and stopping, between moving forward and stepping back, between ambition and limitation, “knowing” is what preserves our capacity to choose. And only when that capacity remains do we truly own our journey of creating value.</p>
