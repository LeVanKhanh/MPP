                <p>There is no shortage of goals set, no shortage of strategies drawn up, and no shortage of people who work hard. Yet value still often fails to appear.</p>

                <p>The problem is not that we have not done enough, but that we <strong>have not completed the path from value to action</strong>, and lack a mechanism to self-correct when reality does not follow the plan.</p>

                <p>The strategic framework in this chapter is not meant to provide more methods, but to clarify the links between <strong>what we pursue</strong> – <strong>the problems we must solve</strong> – <strong>the choices we make</strong> – and <strong>how those choices are translated into daily behavior</strong>.</p>

                <p>Strategy, in this approach, is not a fixed plan, but a <strong>living hypothesis</strong>: formed from understanding, tested through action, and sustained by the ability to learn and self-correct. Only then can value accumulate sustainably, instead of depending on inspiration or momentary effort.</p>

                    <li>The framework links: pursuit → problem → choice → daily behavior.</li>
