        <!-- 1. The role of goals -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Goals as the destination of a journey</h3>

            <p>We are on a journey of creating value. But every journey needs a destination—not to arrive quickly, but to know where we are going. If we cannot define the value we want to create, every effort, no matter how busy, can drift into a state of floating, like being adrift at sea without direction. We may go very far, but not know what we are leaving behind or moving toward.</p>

            <p>The target value is the final destination of that journey. It does not have to be clear from the start, but it needs to be enough to keep us from losing direction. When we know what meaningful thing we seek, we can tell the difference between moving forward and merely moving without aim.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 2. The nature of target value -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Target value and how we choose to live</h3>

            <p>Some goals come from within: wealth, stability, a life with fewer worries. Other goals go beyond the individual: a better society, less suffering, a more harmonious world. In the history of thought, we have seen very different paths. After enlightenment, the Buddha chose a path of awakening and liberating beings. Jesus also carried the ideal of saving humanity from suffering and sin.</p>

            <p>From this, a natural question arises: do we want to engage in the active world, intervening to change things toward what we believe is better? Or do we choose to follow nature, living in non-action, letting things unfold in their own order? These two paths do not exclude one another, and neither is inherently higher than the other.</p>

            <p>Each choice reflects a way of living, a value system, and a level of willingness to bear its own consequences. What matters is not whether the goal is large or small, personal or communal, but whether that goal harms others.</p>

            <p>Not everyone needs to save the world.
                <br>But everyone needs to be responsible for the goal they pursue.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. When the goal is unclear -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">When the value is not yet clear</h3>

            <p>If we cannot clearly define the value we want to pursue, there is a safe and durable anchor: self-cultivation. Health and intelligence are the two most foundational values we can invest in without fear of being in the wrong context.</p>

            <p>When intelligence matures, we gradually recognize what we truly want to pursue. When we have health, we have the ability to do it. This is not a shortcut; it is the first necessary path we must take in the journey of creating value.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. From value to goal -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">From abstract value to concrete goals</h3>

            <p>Once we have a direction of value—even if still unclear—the next step is to set goals. Goals are how we translate abstract value into concrete touchpoints in reality.</p>

            <p>Without goals, value remains only a desire. But it must be emphasized: a goal is not the value itself; it is only a means to gradually create that value.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 5. Small goals and progress -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Start with achievable goals</h3>

            <p>If we cannot yet set large or long-term goals, that is not failure. When capability is limited, set smaller, short-term goals that are achievable.</p>

            <p>Moving slowly is not frightening; more frightening is standing still while waiting for a perfect goal.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 6. MVP as a starting philosophy -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">MVP — starting before perfection</h3>

            <p>This approach in engineering is often called Minimum Viable Product (MVP). But outside the tech context, MVP is essentially a very human philosophy: instead of waiting for a perfect version, create the smallest version sufficient to exist and learn.</p>

            <p>Not everything of value begins in a complete form.
                <br>But every value needs a starting point small enough to begin.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 7. Flexibility of goals -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Goals are not immutable</h3>

            <p>We must also accept a less-spoken truth: goals are not immutable. When context changes, when awareness changes, a goal that was once right may no longer fit.</p>

            <p>Adjusting goals is not weakness, but a sign of clear thinking.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 8. Desires and needs -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Distinguish wants from needs</h3>

            <p>Finally, we must distinguish clearly between what we want and what we need. When foundational needs are not secured, pursuing higher goals becomes fragile and easily collapses.</p>

            <p>Goals give us direction. But understanding value and need determines how far we can go.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- 9. SMART -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">SMART — discipline so we do not deceive ourselves</h3>

            <p>Value gives direction, but to move into action, it must be translated into goals with clear form. This is why frameworks like SMART were created.</p>

            <p>SMART is not a formula for success. SMART is a discipline of thinking.</p>

            <p><b>S - Specific</b><br>Goals must be clear enough to avoid emotional reinterpretation.</p>
            <p><b>M - Measurable</b><br>A goal that cannot be measured can easily stretch endlessly.</p>
            <p><b>A - Achievable</b><br>Goals should require effort but still be within reachable limits.</p>
            <p><b>R - Relevant (to value)</b><br>A goal that does not serve value will only make us busier.</p>
            <p><b>T - Time-bound</b><br>A goal without a time limit will always be delayed.</p>

            <p>SMART does not help us choose the right goal; it only prevents us from deceiving ourselves about the goal we chose.</p>
