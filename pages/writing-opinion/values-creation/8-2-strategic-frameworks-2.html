        <!-- 1. Why strategic thinking is needed -->

            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Why strategic thinking is needed</h3>

            <p>
                We have many different ways to move toward our goals.
                For many people, diligence and persistence day after day are already a good path.
                Not everyone needs multiple methods, and not every circumstance requires
                complex approaches.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, once we have more knowledge, or have been trained to view problems
                more systematically, we can slow down one step.
                <b>Not to do less, but to understand clearly what we are doing and why.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                There is a simple but important observation:
                <b>what we want to achieve is often what we do not yet have</b>,
                and to create it, we must invest effort.
                When everything goes smoothly, action almost naturally leads to results,
                and strategic thinking does not feel necessary.
            </p>

            <p>
                The issue begins when the goal does not take shape on its own.
                When we have tried but results still do not come,
                the question is no longer how much more effort is needed,
                but <b>what is preventing us from getting what we want</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead of continuing to push action unconsciously,
                we need to pause to identify the <b>real problem</b>
                standing between us and the goal.
                Strategy begins at this pause.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 2. Identify the core problem -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Identify the core problem</h3>

            <p>
                We begin by identifying the <b>core problem</b>.
                Symptoms are what we can easily observe,
                but symptoms themselves are not what need to be addressed.
                When the root cause is resolved,
                those symptoms gradually disappear.
            </p>

            <!-- Tool mention (very subtle) -->
            <p>
                In practice, tracing root causes can be supported by
                tools such as <b>Root Cause Analysis</b>
                or the <b>Fishbone diagram</b>.
                However, these tools do not provide answers for us;
                they only help structure our thinking.
                What matters is still <b>the ability to ask the right and deep enough questions</b>
                before drawing a conclusion.
            </p>

            <p>
                In reality, the core problem rarely appears clearly.
                It often hides behind overlapping symptoms.
                Therefore, <b>at each stage we should focus on solving one
                and only one most important core problem</b>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 3. Place the problem in the right context -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Place the problem in the right context</h3>

            <p>
                To solve a problem, we cannot separate it from the context in which it exists.
                Besides external context, we also need to look back at ourselves:
                <b>what our capabilities are, what we do well,
                and what we still lack</b>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Only by placing the problem in the right context—both external and internal—
                can we choose an appropriate direction,
                instead of acting in ambiguity or unrealistic expectation.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 4. Tools to view the whole picture -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Tools to see the whole picture</h3>

            <p>
                Here, the <b>SWOT</b> matrix can be used as a thinking aid.
                SWOT does not draw conclusions for us,
                but helps us see our situation more clearly.
            </p>

            <p>
                The important point when using SWOT
                is not to list everything,
                but <b>how we connect those elements to the core problem</b>
                that needs solving.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 5. Expand the solution space -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Expand the solution space</h3>

            <p>
                Once the core problem is seen in the right context,
                we do not rush to decide.
                <b>There is rarely only one way to solve a problem.</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                At this stage, what we need is not the “most correct” solution,
                but to <b>expand the solution space</b>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 6. Weigh trade-offs -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Weigh trade-offs and measurement</h3>

            <p>
                When options are on the table,
                we begin to view them through the lens of
                <b>cost, time, and resources</b>.
                Measurement is not to maximize benefit,
                but to understand trade-offs.
            </p>

            <p>
                ROI, therefore, is not only money,
                but <b>time, energy, and opportunity</b>.
                The core question is not “how much do we gain,”
                but “is it worth continuing.”
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- 7. Translate into action -->
        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Translate into feasible action</h3>

            <p>
                Finally, when choices are clear enough,
                the issue is no longer thinking more,
                but <b>turning the choice into feasible action</b>.
                <b>From goals to action is not a leap,
                but a process of translation.</b>
            </p>
        </div>
