        <p class="intro-text">
            Strategy answers the question “which direction should we go.”
            But strategy, by itself, does not create value.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many people have clear goals, sound analysis, even carefully built strategies.
            Yet value still does not appear.
            Not because they chose the wrong direction, but because strategy was not
            translated into action in the right way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Between strategy and action there is always a gap.
            That gap is not about knowledge, but about how people turn
            abstract choices into concrete daily behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the strategy phase, we identified a list of actions to take.
            The next step is to choose the order and deploy those actions.

        <h2 class="main-point">Three Principles for Action Prioritization</h2>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Prioritize by impact</h3>
            <p>
                Not all actions contribute equally to the final outcome.
                By the 80/20 principle, most value often comes from a small number of actions
                done in the right place. Therefore, we should identify which actions have
                the greatest impact on the goal and do them first.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Prioritize by timing</h3>
            <p>
                Some actions, if not done early, can no longer be done,
                or will create additional cost, risk, and complexity later.
                Because time is always limited, we must distinguish between
                what must be done now and what can be delayed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Start before everything is perfectly clear</h3>
            <p>
                When we cannot identify the optimal starting point,
                the most effective approach is to begin with any feasible action.
                A concrete action produces information, feedback, and new context,
                which then clarifies what the next step should be.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="intro-text">
            This section does not treat time management as a separate topic.
            When actions are correctly prioritized by impact, timing,
            and feasibility, time use is naturally optimized.

        <h2 class="main-point">Tools to Support Action Choice and Deployment</h2>
        <p class="intro-text">
            The tools below are not meant to be applied all at once,
            nor to create the feeling of “having enough methods.”
            They exist as practical anchors,
            helping translate strategic choices into concrete action
            across different contexts.
            What matters is not how many tools are used,
            but the ability to choose the right tool for the right problem at the right time.
        </p>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Impact - Effort Matrix</h3>
            <p><strong>Use when:</strong> There are many actions to take but limited resources.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Identify priority based on impact and cost.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>
            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li><strong>Impact:</strong> contribution to the goal</li>
                <li><strong>Effort:</strong> time, energy, and resources required</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Evaluating impact by feeling or confusing “hard work” with “important work.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Action List instead of To-do List</h3>
            <p><strong>Use when:</strong> The plan exists on paper but action does not happen.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Turn intention into executable behavior.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>
            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li>Each item starts with an action verb</li>
                <li>Has an observable outcome</li>
                <li>Small enough to finish in one sitting</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Listing only concepts or general goals.</p>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Time-boxing - Time limits</h3>
            <p><strong>Use when:</strong> Action is delayed due to perfectionism or heavy workload.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Force action within a fixed time window.</p>
            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li>Assign a fixed time block to one action</li>
                <li>Focus only within that block</li>
                <li>Do not extend to wait for perfection</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Treating time-boxes as time estimates.</p>

            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li>Review what was done</li>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Treating review as a performance report.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Strategy only begins to have value when it is translated into
            <b>concrete steps</b>.
            The principles and tools in this chapter are not meant to help us do more,
            but to <b>choose the right work to do, at the right time, with a reasonable level
            of effort</b>.
            When implementation steps are clear and intentional,
            execution no longer depends too much on inspiration or momentary willpower.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, <b>scattered efforts</b> produce only short-term results.
            Value truly accumulates only when the necessary work
            <b>is organized into a stable execution mechanism</b>
            that can be maintained, adjusted, and self-corrected over time.
            From here, the focus is no longer on the question <b>“what to do next”</b>,
            but on <b>building a system good enough so that right choices
            can be repeated consistently</b>.

        <h2 class="main-point">Tools to Keep Strategy Moving</h2>

        <p class="intro-text">
            Strategy is not a fixed blueprint, but a living hypothesis.
            When it is put into action, it collides with reality, and reality always creates
            deviation. The tools below do not replace thinking, but help thinking be tested,
            adjusted, and sustained over time.

            <p><strong>Use when:</strong> You need a continuous improvement mechanism, especially in uncertain contexts.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Turn action into data to reduce errors and learn faster.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>
            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li><strong>Plan:</strong> define assumptions and evaluation criteria (what success looks like)</li>
                <li><strong>Do:</strong> execute on a small enough scope to control risk</li>
                <li><strong>Check:</strong> observe results against criteria, avoid rationalization</li>
                <li><strong>Act:</strong> standardize what works, adjust what doesn’t, or change assumptions</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Doing a lot of “Do” without “Check” and “Act,” replacing progress with busyness.</p>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">Five Dynamics of Growth - When growth is not just “doing more”</h3>
             <p class="intro-text">
                When a strategy works only through constant pushing,
                that is usually not an effort problem,
                but a sign that one or more foundational drivers
                in the growth system are missing or out of sync.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Use when:</strong> You want to view growth as a system rather than a chain of scattered efforts.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Identify foundational forces that give strategy momentum and endurance.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use:</strong> See growth as coordination of multiple forces at once, for example:</p>
            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li><strong>Core capability:</strong> what we truly do well</li>
                <li><strong>Support systems:</strong> processes, tools, and environments that sustain quality</li>
                <li><strong>People:</strong> capability, motivation, and alignment</li>
                <li><strong>Learning culture:</strong> reflection, exchange, and improvement</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptation:</strong> the ability to change direction when context changes</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Optimizing one driver (often short-term performance) while weakening the rest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h3 class="sub-point-1">The Three-Box Solution - Manage the present, let go of the past, build the future</h3>
            <p><strong>Use when:</strong> When you (or your organization) do the present well but struggle to make a leap for the future.</p>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Organize attention and resources across three “spaces” that must coexist.</p>
            <p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>
            <ul class="outline-list">
                <li><strong>Box 1 - Optimize the present:</strong> strengthen what creates value today</li>
                <li><strong>Box 2 - Break from the past:</strong> deliberately abandon what was once right but no longer fits</li>
                <li><strong>Box 3 - Build the future:</strong> invest in what has no immediate result but needs time to form</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Living too long in Box 1 and calling it “focus.”</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            If the tools in the previous section help us <b>choose the right work</b>,
            then the tools here help us <b>avoid standing still inside our own choices</b>.
            In reality, what makes the difference is not necessarily “being right from the start,”
            but the <b>ability to self-correct</b> when reality gives feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
            Strategy, therefore, is not just a destination drawn in advance.
            It is a process of maturation: moving, learning, letting go, and rebuilding.
            And when action is organized into a learning mechanism, value begins to accumulate
            not by relying too much on inspiration, but on a <b>steady rhythm of improvement</b>.
