                    After understanding what needs to be done, starting to act, and facing reality,
                    people often do not stop for lack of knowledge, but for lack of momentum.

                    This chapter does not add another skill, but serves as an anchor:
                    helping us keep going, adjust when we drift, and learn from what we have done.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Small wins and psychological reinforcement</h2>
                <p><strong>Maintaining momentum</strong></p>
                <p>
                    People are not sustained by big goals, but by the feeling that
                    <em>they are moving in the right direction</em>.
                    A small win—finishing a task, improving a detail, fixing a deviation—
                    sends an important psychological signal: <em>effort has meaning</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These wins do not make us move faster immediately,
                    but they help us <strong>not stop</strong>.
                    And in the journey of creating value, not stopping is often more important than going fast.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Overcoming procrastination</h2>
                <p><strong>Don’t push, but do start</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Procrastination rarely comes from laziness.
                    It often comes from ambiguity, pressure to do things “right,”
                    or fear of facing real feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The greatest inertia lies in the moment of starting.
                    Once movement happens—even very small—resistance drops quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the goal is not to force ourselves to move fast,
                    but to lower the barrier so we can begin.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Feedback loops</h2>
                <p><strong>Refine rather than judge</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Action only creates value when placed within a feedback loop.
                    Feedback is not to prove us right or wrong,
                    but to help us adjust more accurately to reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When feedback is treated as data, we learn.
                    When feedback is treated as judgment, we defend.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Build – Measure – Learn</h2>
                <p><strong>A basis to move forward</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We cannot evaluate without measurement.
                    And we cannot learn without a basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Build – Measure – Learn loop
                    turns perception into data,
                    assumptions into testable things,
                    and experience into understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, speed does not come from rushing,
                    but from reducing deviation after each loop.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This chapter does not push action,
                    but helps us keep going without exhausting ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consistency is nourished by small steps,
                    guided by feedback,
                    and accelerated with awareness.
