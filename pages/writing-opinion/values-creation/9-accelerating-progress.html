                    After understanding what needs to be done, starting to act, and facing reality,
                    people often do not stop for lack of knowledge, but for lack of momentum.

                <p>
                    This chapter does not add another skill, but serves as an anchor:
                    helping us keep going, adjust when we drift, and learn from what we have done.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Small wins and psychological reinforcement</h2>
                <p><strong>Maintaining momentum</strong></p>
                <p>
                    People are not sustained by big goals, but by the feeling that
                    <em>they are moving in the right direction</em>.
                    A small win—finishing a task, improving a detail, fixing a deviation—
                    sends an important psychological signal: <em>effort has meaning</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These wins do not make us move faster immediately,
                    but they help us <strong>not stop</strong>.
                    And in the journey of creating value, not stopping is often more important than going fast.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Overcoming procrastination</h2>
                <p><strong>Don’t push, but do start</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Procrastination rarely comes from laziness.
                    It often comes from ambiguity, pressure to do things “right,”
                    or fear of facing real feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The greatest inertia lies in the moment of starting.
                    Once movement happens—even very small—resistance drops quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, the goal is not to force ourselves to move fast,
                    but to lower the barrier so we can begin.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Feedback loops</h2>
                <p><strong>Refine rather than judge</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Action only creates value when placed within a feedback loop.
                    Feedback is not to prove us right or wrong,
                    but to help us adjust more accurately to reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When feedback is treated as data, we learn.
                    When feedback is treated as judgment, we defend.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-section">
                <h2>Build – Measure – Learn</h2>
                <p><strong>A basis to move forward</strong></p>
                <p>
                    We cannot evaluate without measurement.
                    And we cannot learn without a basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Build – Measure – Learn loop
                    turns perception into data,
                    assumptions into testable things,
                    and experience into understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, speed does not come from rushing,
                    but from reducing deviation after each loop.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    This chapter does not push action,
                    but helps us keep going without exhausting ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consistency is nourished by small steps,
                    guided by feedback,
                    and accelerated with awareness.
